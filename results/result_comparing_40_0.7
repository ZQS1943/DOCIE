The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist - inspired group. Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels. The police academy car bombing “ was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [ Cuba acting ] to avoid justice being done ”, Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima.

Two gunmen entered the campus right after the explosion and shot at many Afghan soldiers before being gunned down during the clashes. Defense ministry officials said the Taliban had used U. S. - made armored Humvee vehicles captured from Afghan forces as a car bomb in order to breach the military fortifications. A second source residing in Maidan Wardak province said more than 100 members of National Directorate of Security ( NDS ) were killed in the complex attack. " I have been in touch with the NDS official in the province and they told me that over 100  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  members of the NDS were killed in the big explosion, " the former provincial official said. Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak said he  <tgr>  saw  <tgr>  bodies of 35 Afghan forces in the hospital. " Many more were killed. Several  <tag>  PassengerArtifact  </tag>  bodies were transported to  <tag>  Destination  </tag>  Kabul city and many  <tag>  PassengerArtifact  </tag>  injured were transferred to  <tag>  Destination  </tag>  hospitals in Kabul, " said Hotak, adding that " the government was hiding the accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in the morale of the Afghan forces. " " The explosion was very powerful. The whole building has collapsed, " he said. Government officials in Maidan Wardak and Kabul declined to comment when asked if they were obscuring the death toll. Two senior officials in the interior ministry said the exact casualty figures were not being disclosed to prevent unrest within the armed forces. " I have been told not to make the death toll figures public. It is frustrating to hide the facts, " said a senior interior ministry official in Kabul.

Two blocks from the blast scene, a group of people emerged from a screening of the animated movie “ Beauty and the Beast ” and saw the flashing lights. One man who came out of the theater said he could not hear anything and had no idea about the explosion not far from where he was sitting. President Obama was briefed on the situation in New York and will be updated as more information becomes available, a White House official said late Saturday. Speaking in Colorado not long after the explosion, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump quickly commented on the situation before much information was known. “ I must tell you that just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what ’ s going on, ”  <tgr>  said  <tgr>  Trump shortly after getting off of his plane. His comments were made before authorities confirmed the nature of the explosion. Late Saturday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said it was important to “ know the facts ” before drawing conclusions about such incidents. Early Sunday, posts on social media from people in New York showed the area of the explosion to be relatively calm and quiet. Authorities had closed large swaths of roads in the area Saturday night. On Sunday, several roads had reopened but there remained a large police presence in the area. The explosion in New York comes as foreign leaders, including many heads of state, are heading to Manhattan for the United Nations General Assembly. Secretary of State John F. Kerry arrived Saturday, while Obama is scheduled to head to the city on Monday.

 <arg>  detonated or exploded  <arg>  explosive device using  <arg>  to attack  <arg>  target at  <arg>  place But until Monday at the Boston Marathon finish line in Copley Square, such street - level bombings targeting sidewalk or marketplace crowds had not taken place on American soil. US law enforcement and intelligence officials across the country and overseas, scrambling to identify the source of the explosives, are now worried that the marathon sidewalk bombing could mark a new chapter in the struggle to secure the American homeland. Advertisement “ We ’ ve seen this around the world, but what is so concerning about this is that it hadn ’ t happened here, not like this. Until yesterday, ’’ said a senior homeland security official in Washington. The Boston bombs were packed into pressure cookers and hidden in backpacks or duffel bags, according to multiple press accounts citing unidentified sources, another similarity with some  <tag>  Place  </tag>  Mideast attacks using “ improvised explosive  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice  </tag>  devices, ’’ or  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice  </tag>  IEDs. One of the bombs used in a foiled  <tgr>  attack  <tgr>  in New York ’ s Times Square in 2010 was fashioned from a pressure cooker. A joint warning issued by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in 2010 said pressure cookers has been used for bombs in multiple attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal. Reports from medical staff at Boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with BB ’ s, nails, and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage. That contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in Oklahoma City in 1995 and in the garage of the World Trade Center North Tower in 1993, which were intended to inflict damage on buildings, as well as people. IED ’ s pack a much smaller punch, are cheaper, and easier to carry. They have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan with devastating effect on American troops in convoys of military vehicles.

 <arg>  detonated or exploded  <arg>  explosive device using  <arg>  to attack  <arg>  target at  <arg>  place Wearing a dark blue jump suit, Rahimi, 28, shuffled slowly into federal court in Manhattan and had several coughing fits during the brief hearing. He suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing. He spoke only once, when U. S. District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday. " Yes, sir, " Rahimi said. Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U. S.  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan's  <tag>  Place  </tag>  Chelsea neighborhood on Sept. 17. It did not kill  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  anyone but hurt 30  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  people. The  <tgr>  attack  <tgr>  came hours after authorities say another pipe  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice  </tag>  bomb planted by  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in  <tag>  Place  </tag>  New Jersey, although that detonation did not injure  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  anyone. Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey. He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds, delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed. Assistant U. S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi's movements on the day of the bombings, including leaving his house carrying bags, walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street. He also said the government has records showing Rahimi purchased bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs.

He said the devices in New Jersey were “ pipe bombs, ” and those in Chelsea were not. Cuomo said agents in New York were in touch with those in New Jersey. AD Cuomo said officials “ have no reason to believe at this time that there is any further immediate threat, ” though the National Guard and the New York State Police were deploying an additional 1, 000 personnel to bus terminals, airports and subways “ just to err on the side of caution. ” AD Cuomo said the blast in Chelsea “ caused significant property damage, ” though he a nearby subway station was structurally safe.  <tag>  Communicator  </tag>  He said law enforcement would work diligently to identify and locate those responsible. “ Whoever placed these bombs, we will find, and they will be brought to justice, ” Cuomo  <tgr>  said  <tgr> .

A spokeswoman for Lenox Health Greenwich Village, which treated nine of the victims, said patients were treated for minor injuries that included lacerations to the head and body. Other hospitals declined to provide specifics about the extent of patients ’ injuries from the explosion. AD Photos and accounts posted on social media Saturday night showed large crowds — as well as a large law enforcement presence — in the area near where the explosion occurred.

 <arg>  attacked  <arg>  using  <arg>  at  <arg>  place The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men, women and children in danger ”. This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case. The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher. That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014. The country has since come under frequent US bombardment, in an unreported war that saw 1, 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015. Afghan civilian casualties have been high, with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least 85 deaths in 2016. The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period. We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015. Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama ’ s first term. The pace of attacks had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of Bush ’ s term, after four years pocked by occasional strikes. However in the year after taking office,  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  Obama ordered more  <tag>  Instrument  </tag>  drone strikes than Bush did during his entire presidency.

 <arg>  communicated with  <arg>  about  <arg>  topic at  <arg>  place (document does not specify in person or not, or one-way or not) Thai Authorities Indict 2 Over August Shrine Attack A Bangkok military court has indicted two men accused of carrying out the August 17 bombing at a popular shrine that killed 20 people. The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast, including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder. Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror, and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism. Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  Bilal and  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  Mieraili have been detained. They are described as ethnic Uighurs, a minority group based in China's Xinjiang region.  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September. Thai officials have  <tgr>  said  <tgr>  the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation. The August 17 blast at the  <tag>  Target  </tag>  Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades, and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured. Of the dead, 14 were tourists. The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness, which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror. Authorities, however, have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country's huge tourism industry. Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests. Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others. The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb. Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived, said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai. Doubts about motive

 <arg>  arrested or jailed  <arg>  for  <arg>  crime at  <arg>  place The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last May, when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government. Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang said before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage, witnesses, DNA matching and physical evidence, in addition to their confessions. Security camera footage from the Erawan Shrine showed a man wearing a yellow T - shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine, took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away. Time stamps on closed circuit TV footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred, during evening rush hour as the area in central Bangkok was filled with people. Police believe that Bilal is the yellow - shirted man who planted the bomb and Yusufu is believed to have detonated the bomb. Bilal, was initially identified as Adem Karadag, which was the name on a fake Turkish passport in his possession when  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  he was arrested Aug. 29.  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  He was arrested at one of two  <tag>  Place  </tag>  apartments  <tag>  Jailer  </tag>  police raided on the outskirts of Bangkok.

Police said they have confessions from the two, and Bilal's lawyer says his client admitted planting the deadly bomb at the behest of another suspect who remains a fugitive. He says Bilal was induced to carry out the action by a promise that his emigration to Turkey would be expedited. Some material for this report came from AP.

April 13, 2013 Tamerlan Tsarnaev purchases ammunition from a store in New Hampshire and sends $ 900 in cash through Moneygram to his and Dzhokhar ’ s mother, Zubeidat, through a location in Somerville. April 14, 2013 Dzhokhar Tsarnaev opens a prepaid cellphone account under the name Jahar Tsarni. He would use this phone while at the Boston Marathon the next day. On the same day, Tamerlan Tsarnaev  <tgr>  buys  <tgr>  two backpacks at a Target in Watertown that were used to carry the bombs. Federal Public Defender Office April 15, 2013 At about 2 : 50 p. m., two homemade pressure - cooker bombs are detonated remotely by the Tsarnaevs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three and injuring some 260 others. Seventeen people lost limbs. April 15, 2013 Less than a half hour after the bombs went off, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was seen entering the Whole Foods at Prospect Street in Cambridge and looking over different milk products. He buys a carton of whole milk for $ 3. 49, then returns to parked car in the store lot. He enters the passenger side, suggesting another person, possibly Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was at the wheel. Within seconds, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev gets out of the car and exchanges his purchase for a different type of milk. April 26, 2013 Days later, the FBI recovered a backpack belonging to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, which contained tubes of fireworks.

 <arg>  committed a crime against  <arg>  at  <arg>  place By MARI YAMAGUCHI, Associated Press TOKYO ( AP ) — Japanese police have arrested a man who admitted to landing a drone with low - level radioactive sand on the roof of the prime minister's office to protest the government's nuclear energy policy, officials said Saturday. Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto, 40, turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan. The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices, the prime ministers'office has said. The infiltration at Japan's political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there. No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident. Police said  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and  <tgr>  obstructing duties  <tgr>  at the prime minister's office. He has not been indicted and faces further questioning. Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government's nuclear energy policy. Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan's 48 reactors, which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster. Abe's administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible. The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium, levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment. The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima, where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns, NHK said.

 <arg>  detonated or exploded  <arg>  explosive device using  <arg>  to attack  <arg>  target at  <arg>  place The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men, women and children in danger ”. This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case. The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher. That figure does not include deaths in active  <tag>  Place  </tag>  battlefields including  <tag>  Place  </tag>  Afghanistan – where US  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014. The country has since come under frequent US  <tgr>  bombardment  <tgr> , in an unreported war that saw 1, 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015. Afghan civilian casualties have been high, with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least 85 deaths in 2016. The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period. We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015. Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama ’ s first term. The pace of attacks had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of Bush ’ s term, after four years pocked by occasional strikes. However in the year after taking office, Obama ordered more drone strikes than Bush did during his entire presidency. The 54 strikes in 2009 all took place in Pakistan.

They have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan with devastating effect on American troops in convoys of military vehicles. Advertisement No one has taken responsibility for the twin bombings on Boylston Street that killed three people and injured more than 150 near the Boston marathon finish line. A senior US law enforcement official in Washington added that the fact that no group has taken responsibility has officials speculating that it might not be the work of a well - known international terrorist group like Al Qaeda, Hezbollah or one of its affiliates but a domestic group or individual inspired by the hallmark tactics of terrorist groups in recent years, The Pakistani  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  Taliban also  <tgr>  said  <tgr>  in a statement it was not responsible for the attack, unlike the attempted car bombing in New York ’ s Times Square in 2010 that it claimed responsibility for. But officials in Washington have been warning about the possibility of so - called improvised explosive devises in recent weeks. In late february the White House established a new task force housed in the Department of Justice to apply the lessons learned from years of dealing with so - called improvised explosive devices — some large and powerful and others more limited in scope like the ones apparently set off on Boylston Street yesterday. “ The threat from IED use is likely to remain high in the near future, and will continue to evolve in response to our abilities to counter them, ’’ according to a new strategy approved by President Obama on February 26. “ A whole - of - government approach that integrates Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and global participation in counter - IED activities will best position the United States to discover plots to use IEDs in the United States, or against U. S. persons abroad, before those threats become imminent. ’’

 <arg>  arrested or jailed  <arg>  for  <arg>  crime at  <arg>  place By MARI YAMAGUCHI, Associated Press TOKYO ( AP ) — Japanese police have  <tgr>  arrested  <tgr>  a man who admitted to landing a drone with low - level radioactive sand on the roof of the prime minister's office to protest the government's nuclear energy policy, officials said Saturday. Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto, 40, turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan. The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices, the prime ministers'office has said. The infiltration at Japan's political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there. No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident. Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister's office. He has not been indicted and faces further questioning. Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government's nuclear energy policy. Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan's 48 reactors, which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster. Abe's administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible. The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium, levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment. The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima, where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns, NHK said.

 <arg>  detonated or exploded  <arg>  explosive device using  <arg>  to attack  <arg>  target at  <arg>  place Thai Authorities Indict 2 Over August Shrine Attack A Bangkok military court has indicted two men accused of carrying out the August 17 bombing at a popular shrine that killed 20 people. The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast, including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder. Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror, and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism. Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the  <tgr>  bombing  <tgr>  but only  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  Bilal and Mieraili have been detained. They are described as ethnic Uighurs, a minority group based in China's Xinjiang region.  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September. Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation. The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades, and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured. Of the dead, 14 were tourists. The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness, which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror. Authorities, however, have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country's huge tourism industry. Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests. Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others. The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb. Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived, said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai. Doubts about motive

 <arg>  charged or indicted  <arg>  before  <arg>  court or judge for  <arg>  crime in  <arg>  place " Yes, sir, " Rahimi said. Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U. S. citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Sept. 17. It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people. The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey, although that detonation did not injure anyone. Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice  </tag>  bomb in  <tag>  Place  </tag>  Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces  <tgr>  charges  <tgr>  from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey.  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police  <tag>  Jailer  </tag>  officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds, delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed. Assistant U. S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi's movements on the day of the bombings, including leaving his house carrying bags, walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street. He also said the government has records showing Rahimi purchased bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs. Lewin asked Berman to consider a trial date in the " late winter " or " early spring, " saying the amount of evidence in the case is relatively limited. Berman scheduled court dates for Dec. 19 and Jan. 31 but has not set a trial date. Rahimi's court - appointed defense lawyers declined to comment after the hearing.

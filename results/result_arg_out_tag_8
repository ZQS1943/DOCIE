I think the jury did the right thing. ” Krystle Campbell's best friend, Karen Rand McWatters, who  <tgr>  lost  <tgr>  a leg in the attack, said Tsarnaev " can't possibly have had a soul to do such a horrible thing. ” In a message he scrawled in the boat he was found hiding in, Tsarnaev said the attack was retaliation against the U. S. for its wars in Muslim countries. McWatters urged Tsarnaev to show remorse to discourage other jihadis from killing people in similar attacks. “ You can save them from these cowardly acts if you really have an ounce of regret, ” she said. Rebekah Gregory, a Texas woman who lost a leg in the bombing, defiantly told Tsarnaev she was not his victim. “ While your intention was to destroy America, what you have really accomplished is actually quite the opposite — you've unified us, ” she said. " We are Boston strong, we are America strong, and choosing to mess with us was a terrible idea. So how's that for your VICTIM impact statement? ”'He is a leech '

" I have been in touch with the NDS official in the province and they told me that over 100 members of the NDS were killed in the big explosion, " the former provincial official said.

" " The explosion was very powerful. The whole building has collapsed, " he said. Government officials in Maidan Wardak and Kabul declined to comment when asked if they were obscuring the death toll. Two senior officials in the interior ministry said the exact casualty figures were not being disclosed to prevent unrest within the armed forces. " I have been told not to make the death toll figures public. It is frustrating to hide the facts, " said a senior interior ministry official in Kabul. A senior NDS official in Kabul said at least 50 people were killed or wounded in the complex attack.

Colombia has asked Cuba to hand over the rebels affiliated with National Liberation Army ( ELN ), who were in Havana for peace talks, after a deadly car  <tgr>  bombing  <tgr>  in Bogota was blamed on the group. Conservative President Ivan Duque urged Communist - ruled Cuba, a host and one of the guarantors of the peace process, to send home the ELN rebels in Havana. Cuba ’ s foreign minister said in a tweet late on Friday that the country would respect the protocols of the negotiations it had been hosting and was consulting with both parties and the guarantors of the talks. On Friday, Colombia blamed the leftist ELN for the bombing of a police academy in Bogota that killed 20 people as well as the attacker, dealing a big blow to the peace process. 190102132047518 Duque then announced that he was reinstating arrest warrants for 10 ELN members, who are part of the group ’ s delegation to the Cuba talks. The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist - inspired group. Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels. The police academy car bombing “ was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [ Cuba acting ] to avoid justice being done ”, Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima. Colombians, including Duque, planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing, the worst such attack in the country in 16 years. Last rebel group In November, Colombia asked Cuba to capture ELN rebel commander Nicolas Rodriguez and provide information about the presence of other commanders in the Cuban territory.

 <arg>  detonated or exploded  <arg>  explosive device using  <arg>  to attack  <arg>  target at  <arg>  place The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey, although that detonation did not injure anyone. Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey. He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds, delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed. Assistant U. S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing  <tag>  Defendant  </tag>  Rahimi's movements on the day of the  <tgr>  bombings  <tgr> , including leaving his house carrying bags, walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street. He also said the government has records showing  <tag>  Recipient  </tag>  Rahimi purchased bomb  <tag>  AcquiredEntity  </tag>  components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs. Lewin asked Berman to consider a trial date in the " late winter " or " early spring, " saying the amount of evidence in the case is relatively limited. Berman scheduled court dates for Dec. 19 and Jan. 31 but has not set a trial date. Rahimi's court - appointed defense lawyers declined to comment after the hearing.

 <arg>  died at  <arg>  place from  <arg>  medical issue, killed by  <arg>  killer A wave of attacks across Iraq on Monday  <tgr>  killed  <tgr>  107 people in the country's deadliest day in more than two years after al - Qaida warned it would mount new attacks and sought to retake territory. Officials said at least 214 people were wounded in 27 different attacks launched in 18 cities, shattering a relative calm which had held in the lead - up to the start on Saturday of the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. In Monday's deadliest attack -- a string of roadside bombs and a car bomb followed by a suicide attack targeting emergency responders in the town of Taji -- at least 42 people were killed and 40 wounded, according to two medical officials. " I heard explosions in the distance so I left my house and I saw a car outside, " said 40 - year - old Taji resident Abu Mohammed, who added that police inspectors concluded the vehicle was a car bomb. " We asked the neighbors to leave their houses, but when they were leaving, the bomb went off. " Abu Mohammed said he witnessed the deaths of an elderly woman carrying a newborn baby and of the policeman who had first concluded the car was packed with explosives. An Agence France Presse reporter at the scene said a row of houses were completely destroyed, and residents were rummaging through the rubble in search of victims and their belongings. In Baghdad, meanwhile, a car bomb outside a government office responsible for producing identity papers in the Shiite bastion of Sadr City killed at least 12 people and wounded 22 others, security and medical officials said. " This attack is a terrible crime against humanity, because they did it during Ramadan, while people are fasting, " said one elderly witness who declined to be identified.

S. citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Sept. 17. It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people. The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey, although that detonation did not injure anyone. Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey. He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds, delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed. Assistant U. S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi's movements on the day of the bombings, including leaving his house carrying bags, walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street. He also said the government has records showing Rahimi  <tgr>  purchased  <tgr>  bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs. Lewin asked Berman to consider a trial date in the " late winter " or " early spring, " saying the amount of evidence in the case is relatively limited. Berman scheduled court dates for Dec. 19 and Jan. 31 but has not set a trial date. Rahimi's court - appointed defense lawyers declined to comment after the hearing.

The caller did not identify either pub, referring instead to The Rotunda, above The Mulberry Bush and the New Street Tax Office, which was above the underground Tavern in The Town. The first bomb destroyed The Mulberry Bush just six minutes later. The Tavern was destroyed at 8. 27pm. Conway was not directly involved in the debrief with the England Operational Commander. But he said he was later told “ that the early indications were that the casualties were the result of yet another failure in the warning system, a succession of phone boxes from which the warning might have been relayed having proved to be inoperable. ” In an interview with a national newspaper he described the  <tag>  Place  </tag>  Birmingham pub bombings as “ a total disaster. ” He added that the secret ‘ Feakle Talks ’, held a couple of weeks after the bombings, were used by the IRA to try to start to repair its image after the Birmingham and the Guildford pub  <tgr>  bombings  <tgr> . The talks, in Feakle, County Clare, involved senior IRA officials and Protestant clergymen and ended abruptly after a tip - off that Irish Special Branch officers were on their way to arrest the republicans. But they set in train a process that eventually led to a brief ceasefire that began on December 22, 1974. Conway had been recruited in 1970, having been radicalised during the 1968 student protest movements. He met with senior republicans, including future deputy first minister of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness and Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams. Adams continues to deny that he was ever in the IRA.

That contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in Oklahoma City in 1995 and in the garage of the World Trade Center North Tower in 1993, which were intended to inflict damage on buildings, as well as people. IED ’ s pack a much smaller punch, are cheaper, and easier to carry. They have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan with devastating effect on American troops in convoys of military vehicles. Advertisement No one has taken responsibility for the twin bombings on Boylston Street that killed three people and  <tgr>  injured  <tgr>  more than 150 near the Boston marathon finish line. A senior US law enforcement official in Washington added that the fact that no group has taken responsibility has officials speculating that it might not be the work of a well - known international terrorist group like Al Qaeda, Hezbollah or one of its affiliates but a domestic group or individual inspired by the hallmark tactics of terrorist groups in recent years, The Pakistani Taliban also said in a statement it was not responsible for the attack, unlike the attempted car bombing in New York ’ s Times Square in 2010 that it claimed responsibility for. But officials in Washington have been warning about the possibility of so - called improvised explosive devises in recent weeks. In late february the White House established a new task force housed in the Department of Justice to apply the lessons learned from years of dealing with so - called improvised explosive devices — some large and powerful and others more limited in scope like the ones apparently set off on Boylston Street yesterday.

Colombia has asked Cuba to hand over the rebels affiliated with National Liberation Army (  <tag>  Recipient  </tag>  ELN ), who were in Havana for peace talks, after a deadly car bombing in Bogota was blamed on the group. Conservative President Ivan Duque urged Communist - ruled Cuba, a host and one of the guarantors of the peace process, to send home the ELN rebels in Havana. Cuba ’ s foreign minister said in a tweet late on Friday that the country would respect the protocols of the negotiations it had been hosting and was consulting with both parties and the guarantors of the talks. On Friday, Colombia blamed the leftist ELN for the bombing of a police academy in Bogota that killed 20 people as well as the attacker, dealing a big blow to the peace process. 190102132047518 Duque then announced that he was reinstating arrest warrants for 10 ELN members, who are part of the group ’ s delegation to the Cuba talks. The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist - inspired group. Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels. The police academy car bombing “ was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [ Cuba acting ] to avoid justice being done ”, Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima. Colombians, including Duque, planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing, the worst such attack in the country in 16 years. Last rebel group In November, Colombia asked Cuba to capture ELN rebel commander Nicolas Rodriguez and provide information about the presence of other commanders in the Cuban territory.

Advertisement No one has taken responsibility for the twin bombings on Boylston Street that killed three people and injured more than 150 near the Boston marathon finish line. A senior US law enforcement official in Washington added that the fact that no group has taken responsibility has officials speculating that it might not be the work of a well - known international terrorist group like Al Qaeda, Hezbollah or one of its affiliates but a domestic group or individual inspired by the hallmark tactics of terrorist groups in recent years, The Pakistani Taliban also said in a statement it was not responsible for the  <tgr>  attack  <tgr> , unlike the attempted car bombing in New York ’ s Times Square in 2010 that it claimed responsibility for. But officials in Washington have been warning about the possibility of so - called improvised explosive devises in recent weeks. In late february the White House established a new task force housed in the Department of Justice to apply the lessons learned from years of dealing with so - called improvised explosive devices — some large and powerful and others more limited in scope like the ones apparently set off on Boylston Street yesterday. “ The threat from IED use is likely to remain high in the near future, and will continue to evolve in response to our abilities to counter them, ’’ according to a new strategy approved by President Obama on February 26. “ A whole - of - government approach that integrates Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and global participation in counter - IED activities will best position the United States to discover plots to use IEDs in the United States, or against U. S. persons abroad, before those threats become imminent. ’’ Advertisement

" I pray for your relief, for your healing,'' he said. Amid deep silence in the courtroom, the 21 - year - old ethnic Chechen said, " I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I've caused you, for the  <tgr>  damage  <tgr>  that I've done — irreparable damage.'' It was the first time Tsarnaev, who did not speak in his own defense at trial, had addressed the court. After Tsarnaev finished, U. S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr. began to speak, with his voice breaking several times. He officially imposed the death sentence on Tsarnaev that jurors had recommended unanimously. In May, after a 12 - week trial, Tsarnaev was found guilty of killing three people and injuring 264 in the April 15, 2013, bombing at the world - renowned race, where he and his brother, Tamerlan, 26, set off two pressure - cooker bombs near the finish line. Tsarnaev was also found guilty in the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer three days later as he and his brother fled. Tamerlan was killed during the getaway. Tsarnaev was found guilty of all 30 terrorism and other charges against him. Of those, 17 carried the possibility of a death sentence. During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings, prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older, radicalized brother. Victims speak out

Walking down the block, they found the second, unexploded device, O ’ Neill said. AD Reports of another suspicious package at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue turned out to be a false alarm — the package was only garbage, J. Peter Donald, a police spokesman, posted on Twitter around 12 : 30 a. m. Sunday. The Chelsea explosion occurred about 11 hours after a pipe bomb exploded in a Jersey Shore garbage can, shortly before a scheduled charity 5K race there benefiting Marines and Navy sailors. AD Authorities have said they have not yet found anything connecting the Chelsea and New Jersey incidents but are continuing to investigate. On Sunday, Cuomo said the “ bombs ” in Chelsea “ appear to be different ” from those discovered earlier in the day in New Jersey, though the devices from both states were being shipped to the FBI lab in Quantico for further assessment. He  <tgr>  said  <tgr>  the devices in New Jersey were “ pipe bombs, ” and those in Chelsea were not. Cuomo said agents in New York were in touch with those in New Jersey. AD Cuomo said officials “ have no reason to believe at this time that there is any further immediate threat, ” though the National Guard and the New York State Police were deploying an additional 1, 000 personnel to bus terminals, airports and subways “ just to err on the side of caution. ” AD Cuomo said the blast in Chelsea “ caused significant property damage, ” though he a nearby subway station was structurally safe. He said law enforcement would work diligently to identify and locate those responsible.

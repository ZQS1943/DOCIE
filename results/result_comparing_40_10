Kieran Conway, who was head of the IRA ’ s intelligence - gathering department in the 1970s, broke a 40 - year silence by the organisation to make the admission. He admitted he was “ appalled and ashamed ” because he claimed the bombing of civilians went against everything it stood for. He said the attacks on The  <tag>  Target  </tag>  Mulberry Bush and The  <tag>  Target  </tag>  Tavern in The Town had been in revenge for the  <tgr>  death  <tgr>  of IRA bomber James McDade. At first he feared that the timing of the attacks - with very little warning - had been deliberate because “ tempers were high ”. But  <tag>  Participant  </tag>  he was later told that the IRA unit involved had tried to use “ a succession of phone boxes ” which were out of order, significantly delaying the bomb - warning call.

The second  <tgr>  bombing  <tgr>  occurred in Kabul near the US embassy. In this incident  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  22 were killed and another  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  38 were injured in the explosion. Children and women are among the dead and wounded in both attacks, also multiple soldiers were killed. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attacks, and said they will commit more attacks to discourage people from voting in the upcoming presidential elections. == Attacks == === Charikar === The attack took place in Charikar, at a police training ground. At the time, Afghan president Ashraf Ghani was holding a political rally at the site, attended by thousands of people. A suicide bomber riding a motorcycle drove into a crowd near a security checkpoint and detonated his explosives. 26 people and the bomber were killed, and 42 others injured. Women and children were among the victims of the attack. President Ghani was unharmed in the attack, remaining protected by a secure compound about half a mile from the site of the blast. === Kabul === A few hours after the first attack, a second suicide bombing took place in Massoud Square near the Kabul Green Zone, in an area where several government buildings, the US embassy and NATO headquarters, are located. 22 people were killed in this attack and 38 injured. == Responsibility == The Taliban claimed responsibility for both attacks, and stated that the attacks were aimed at disrupting the Afghan presidential election, scheduled to take place on September 28. == References ==

 <arg>  attacked  <arg>  using  <arg>  at  <arg>  place The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men, women and children in danger ”. This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case. The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher. That figure does not include deaths in active  <tag>  Place  </tag>  battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air  <tgr>  attacks  <tgr>  have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014.

Afghan civilian casualties have been high, with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least 85 deaths in 2016. The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period. We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015. Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama ’ s first term. The pace of attacks had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of Bush ’ s term, after four years pocked by occasional strikes. However in the year after taking office, Obama ordered more drone strikes than Bush did during his entire presidency. The 54 strikes in 2009 all took place in Pakistan.

 <arg>  detonated or exploded  <arg>  explosive device using  <arg>  to attack  <arg>  target at  <arg>  place " Yes, sir, " Rahimi said. Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U. S. citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Sept. 17. It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people. The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey, although that detonation did not injure anyone. Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey. He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds, delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed. Assistant U. S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi's movements on the day of the  <tgr>  bombings  <tgr> , including leaving his house carrying bags, walking on  <tag>  Place  </tag>  West 23rd Street where the  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice  </tag>  device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street. He also said the government has records showing  <tag>  Recipient  </tag>  Rahimi purchased bomb  <tag>  AcquiredEntity  </tag>  components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs. Lewin asked Berman to consider a trial date in the " late winter " or " early spring, " saying the amount of evidence in the case is relatively limited. Berman scheduled court dates for Dec. 19 and Jan. 31 but has not set a trial date. Rahimi's court - appointed defense lawyers declined to comment after the hearing.

Abe's administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible. The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium, levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment. The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima, where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns, NHK said. The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities. Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial, service and entertainment use. At a meeting Friday, task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones. It is not clear exactly when the drone landed because workers at the office in central Tokyo rarely go up to the roof. An official taking new employees on a building tour reportedly spotted the drone. A blog with an anti - nuclear theme managed under the name " Kantei ( prime minister's office ) Santa " contained photos of a drone that looked like the one found Wednesday. In one entry, the anonymous writer said he drove from his hometown in Obama city in Fukui to Tokyo and flew the drone in the early hours of April 9, trying to have it land in the yard of the prime minister's office, but that he eventually lost track of the device. In the United States in January, a drone flown by an off - duty intelligence employee  <tgr>  crashed  <tgr>  on the White House grounds.

The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist - inspired group. Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels. The police academy car bombing “ was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [ Cuba acting ] to avoid justice being done ”, Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima. Colombians, including Duque, planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing, the worst such attack in the country in 16 years.

The government in Bogota also asked Havana to act on an Interpol Red Notice against Rodriguez. The Cuban government did not respond publicly to that request or made a statement about the issue. Colombia has experienced several years of relative calm since the 2016 peace accord signed by then - President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) fighters. 190118182118648 With the landmark agreement turning the former rebels into a political party, the smaller ELN is considered the last active rebel group in the country. True to his election promises, Duque has taken a hard line against the ELN. Peace talks with the ELN began in February 2017 under Santos, but Duque has put them on hold until the rebels free all their hostages and stop attacks on military and civilian targets.

 <arg>  died at  <arg>  place from  <arg>  medical issue, killed by  <arg>  killer Thai Authorities Indict 2 Over August Shrine Attack A Bangkok military court has indicted two men accused of carrying out the August 17 bombing at a popular shrine that killed 20 people. The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast, including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder. Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror, and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism. Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained. They are described as ethnic Uighurs, a minority group based in China's Xinjiang region. They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September. Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation. The August 17 blast at the  <tag>  Target  </tag>  Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in  <tag>  Place  </tag>  Bangkok in decades, and left 20  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  people dead and more than  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  120 injured. Of the  <tgr>  dead  <tgr> , 14 were tourists. The attack shocked the residents of the  <tag>  Place  </tag>  capital because of the apparent randomness, which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror.  <tag>  Participant  </tag>  Authorities, however, have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country's huge tourism industry. Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests. Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others. The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb. Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived, said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai. Doubts about motive

Police directed people away from that intersection, and one officer could be heard telling pedestrians that “ there is a possible explosive ” in the area. AD Not long after midnight, police said in a statement that they were asking people in the area of this potential explosive to move away from their windows “ until we clear the suspicious package, ” although officers did not fully evacuate the area. AD According to the Associated Press, the second device was  <tgr>  removed  <tgr>  with a robot and taken to the department firing range in the Bronx. O ’ Neill said Sunday that two “ very dedicated ” former New York state troopers had responded to the initial report of the blast last night. In a search for other explosives, they had parked their vehicle on 27th Street. Walking down the block, they found the second, unexploded device, O ’ Neill said. AD Reports of another suspicious package at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue turned out to be a false alarm — the package was only garbage, J. Peter Donald, a police spokesman, posted on Twitter around 12 : 30 a. m. Sunday. The Chelsea explosion occurred about 11 hours after a pipe bomb exploded in a Jersey Shore garbage can, shortly before a scheduled charity 5K race there benefiting Marines and Navy sailors. AD

Abe's administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible. The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium, levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment. The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima, where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns, NHK said. The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities. Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial, service and entertainment use. At a meeting Friday, task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones. It is not clear exactly when the drone landed because workers at the office in central Tokyo rarely go up to the roof. An official taking new employees on a building tour reportedly spotted the drone. A blog with an anti - nuclear theme managed under the name " Kantei ( prime minister's office ) Santa " contained photos of a drone that looked like the one found Wednesday. In one entry, the anonymous writer said he drove from his hometown in Obama city in Fukui to Tokyo and flew the drone in the early hours of April 9, trying to have it land in the yard of the prime minister's office, but that he eventually lost track of the device. In the United States in January, a drone flown by an off - duty intelligence employee  <tgr>  crashed  <tgr>  on the White House grounds.

 <arg>  died at  <arg>  place from  <arg>  medical issue, killed by  <arg>  killer U. S. lawmakers discussed the same trip Tuesday as they raised concerns about the sharing of intelligence among federal law enforcement agencies. Senator Lindsey Graham said the FBI told him it was not aware at the time of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's trip to Russia. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a shootout with police last Thursday, while his younger brother Dzhokhar was captured a day later. Meanwhile, in Boston, authorities on Wednesday reopened Boylston Street, the city thoroughfare where the explosions occurred near the finish line of the race. Later, several thousand people gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a memorial service for campus policeman Sean Collier, who authorities say the Tsarnaev brothers shot to death three days after the bombings. Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano told the Senate Intelligence Committee that her agency did know about Tamerlan's trip, but that an FBI alert on him had expired by the time he returned. The FBI had interviewed Tsarnaev in 2011 at Russia's request, but found nothing to connect him to terrorism at that time. The 19 - year - old Dzhokhar has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction. He is in federal custody in a Boston hospital. U. S. officials say Dzhokhar told them in preliminary interviews that he and his brother were partly motivated by the U. S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but that they were self - radicalized and not connected to any terrorist network. The two suspects are Chechens who came to the United States as boys.

 <arg>  was injured by  <arg>  using  <arg>  in  <arg>  body part with  <arg>  medical issue at  <arg>  place Taliban representatives have met several times with U. S. officials in recent months, but last week threatened to suspend the fledgling process, lambasting Washington for changing the agenda of the talks and " unilaterally " adding new subjects. The insurgents have long refused to hold direct talks with the Kabul government -- despite U. S. pleas -- which the Taliban dismisses as a puppet of Washington. In recent years the Afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures. Last year Ghani has said 28, 000 Afghan police officers and soldiers have been killed since 2015, breaking the longstanding suppression on casualty data. Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline terrorist group said they have killed 190 people in the complex attack. Last week, Taliban  <tag>  Injurer Injurer  </tag>  fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  people and wounding more than 110  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  Afghans and expatriates in the capital, Kabul. On Sunday, a suicide bombing in the southeastern province of  <tag>  Place  </tag>  Logar left eight  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  policemen dead and another 10  <tgr>  wounded  <tgr> . The  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  Taliban bombing targeted the provincial  <tag>  Target  </tag>  governor's convoy in  <tag>  Place  </tag>  Mohammad Agha district. The provincial governor and spy chief traveling in the convoy were unharmed. The Taliban have ramped up their attacks on security forces and government facilities in recent months, while Afghan and U. S. troops have increased operations against the militants'field commanders. Military sources say around 35 members of the country's security forces are killed every day in attacks and clashes. This is while the U. S. is still considering a significant troop drawdown in Afghanistan. Around 14, 000 U. S. troops are stationed in the country, coupled with around 7, 500 troops from other allied nations, according to RAND, a U. S. government research organization.

 <arg>  arrested or jailed  <arg>  for  <arg>  crime at  <arg>  place " Yes, sir, " Rahimi said. Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U. S. citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Sept. 17. It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people. The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey, although that detonation did not injure anyone. Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. In addition to the New York indictment,  <tag>  Defendant  </tag>  Rahimi faces charges from federal and state  <tag>  Prosecutor  </tag>  prosecutors in  <tag>  JudgeCourt  </tag>  New Jersey. He was  <tgr>  captured  <tgr>  after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  him with several gunshot wounds, delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing  <tag>  Defendant  </tag>  him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed. Assistant U. S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi's movements on the day of the bombings, including leaving his house carrying bags, walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street. He also said the government has records showing Rahimi purchased bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs. Lewin asked Berman to consider a trial date in the " late winter " or " early spring, " saying the amount of evidence in the case is relatively limited. Berman scheduled court dates for Dec. 19 and Jan. 31 but has not set a trial date. Rahimi's court - appointed defense lawyers declined to comment after the hearing.

On Friday, Colombia blamed the leftist ELN for the bombing of a police academy in Bogota that killed 20 people as well as the attacker, dealing a big blow to the peace process. 190102132047518 Duque then announced that he was reinstating arrest warrants for 10 ELN members, who are part of the group ’ s delegation to the Cuba talks. The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist - inspired group. Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels. The police academy car bombing “ was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [ Cuba acting ] to avoid justice being done ”, Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima. Colombians, including Duque, planned to join in a march on Sunday to  <tgr>  protest  <tgr>  against the car bombing, the worst such attack in the country in 16 years.

The government in Bogota also asked Havana to act on an Interpol Red Notice against Rodriguez. The Cuban government did not respond publicly to that request or made a statement about the issue. Colombia has experienced several years of relative calm since the 2016 peace accord signed by then - President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) fighters. 190118182118648 With the landmark agreement turning the former rebels into a political party, the smaller ELN is considered the last active rebel group in the country. True to his election promises, Duque has taken a hard line against the ELN.

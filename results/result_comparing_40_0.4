 <arg>  attacked  <arg>  using  <arg>  at  <arg>  place On 27 August 1975 a Provisional IRA bomb exploded without warning at the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey, England. There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured, some severely. Two off - duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing. == Background == In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven " incident centres " were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out bomb and gun  <tgr>  attacks  <tgr>  in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London.  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister  <tag>  Target  </tag>  Edward Heath but he was not home when the  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  attackers threw a  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice  </tag>  bomb into  <tag>  Target  </tag>  his bedroom window on 22 December 1974. == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people. == Aftermath ==

 <arg>  communicated with  <arg>  about  <arg>  topic at  <arg>  place (document does not specify in person or not, or one-way or not) The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s, each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and, when detonated, capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters. DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model, normally used for industrial work — with a U. S. price tag of around $ 5, 000 apiece, suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out — with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30. Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government ’ s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600, noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors. It also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model, although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed. Venezuela ’ s interior minister, Nestor Reverol, also  <tgr>  claimed  <tgr>  the government thwarted the attack using " special techniques and [ radio ] signal inhibitors ", which " disoriented " the  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice ExplosiveDevice  </tag>  drone that detonated closest to the presidential  <tag>  Place  </tag>  stand — a capability Bellingcat notes the Venezuelan security services are reported to have. The second drone was said by Reverol to have " lost control " and crashed into a nearby building. Bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion. It adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed.

Abe's administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible. The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium, levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment. The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima, where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns, NHK said. The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities. Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial, service and entertainment use. At a meeting Friday, task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones. It is not clear exactly when the drone landed because workers at the office in central Tokyo rarely go up to the roof. An official taking new employees on a building tour reportedly spotted the drone. A blog with an anti - nuclear theme managed under the name " Kantei ( prime minister's office ) Santa " contained photos of a drone that looked like the one found Wednesday. In one entry, the anonymous writer said he drove from his hometown in Obama city in Fukui to Tokyo and flew the drone in the early hours of April 9, trying to have it land in the yard of the prime minister's office, but that he eventually lost track of the device. In the United States in January, a drone flown by an off - duty intelligence employee  <tgr>  crashed  <tgr>  on the White House grounds.

Pressure cookers were used in the two bombs detonated at the Boston Marathon in 2013. The bomb squad safely removed the second device, New York police tweeted early Sunday. Police officers, firefighters and other first responders had rushed to the scene of the blast, which closed a major roadway and forced people out of nearby buildings. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio ( D ) said Sunday that the explosion was “ intentional, ” but noted that few details were available because the investigation was in its early stages. “ We know there was a bombing, ” de Blasio said. “ We know it was a very serious incident, but we have a lot more work to do to be able to say what kind of motivation was behind this. ” AD AD He also echoed his comments from Saturday night that there was no specific, credible  <tgr>  threat  <tgr>  against New York from any terrorist group. The FBI and NYPD are trying to understand what motivation lay behind the blast. “ We will look at individuals. We will look at associations. We will look at social media, ” William Sweeney, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI New York Field Office, said. “ Until we have that information it is not fair for us to give a conclusion [ as to motivation ], ” DeBlasio said. “ Let the law enforcement experts draw the conclusions. ” Police Commissioner James O ’ Neill, whose first day in the position was Saturday, told reporters on Sunday that police were still gathering evidence. AD “ We did find some components indicative of an IED … that went off intentionally, ” O ’ Neill said.

He said the devices in New Jersey were “ pipe bombs, ” and those in Chelsea were not. Cuomo said agents in New York were in touch with those in New Jersey. AD Cuomo said officials “ have no reason to believe at this time that there is any further immediate threat, ” though the National Guard and the New York State Police were deploying an additional 1, 000 personnel to bus terminals, airports and subways “ just to err on the side of caution. ” AD  <tag>  Communicator  </tag>  Cuomo said the blast in Chelsea “ caused significant property damage, ” though he a nearby subway station was structurally safe.

" I pray for your relief, for your healing,'' he said. Amid deep silence in the courtroom, the 21 - year - old ethnic Chechen said, " I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I've caused you, for the damage that I've done — irreparable damage.'' It was the first time Tsarnaev, who did not speak in his own defense at trial, had addressed the court. After Tsarnaev finished, U. S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr. began to speak, with his voice breaking several times. He officially imposed the  <tgr>  death  <tgr>  sentence on  <tag>  Defendant  </tag>  Tsarnaev that jurors had recommended unanimously. In May, after a 12 - week trial,  <tag>  Killer Killer  </tag>  Tsarnaev was found guilty of killing three  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  people and injuring  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  264 in the April 15, 2013, bombing at the world - renowned race, where he and his brother, Tamerlan, 26, set off two pressure - cooker bombs near the finish line. Tsarnaev was also found guilty in the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer three days later as he and his brother fled. Tamerlan was killed during the getaway. Tsarnaev was found guilty of all 30 terrorism and other charges against him. Of those, 17 carried the possibility of a death sentence. During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings, prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older, radicalized brother. Victims speak out

There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured, some severely. Two off - duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing. == Background == In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven " incident centres " were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  attackers threw a  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice  </tag>  bomb into his  <tag>  Place  </tag>  bedroom window on 22 December 1974. == The bombing == The  <tag>  ManufacturerAssembler  </tag>  Balcombe Street Gang planted a time  <tag>  Artifact  </tag>  bomb in the  <tag>  Place  </tag>  Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey.

The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people. == Aftermath ==

Neither The Mulberry Bush nor The Tavern in The Town had any military connection. Normal IRA procedure at the time for any attack on non - military targets was to give a 30 - minute warning in order for full evacuations to take place.

The caller did not identify either pub, referring instead to The Rotunda, above The Mulberry Bush and the New Street Tax Office, which was above the underground Tavern in The Town. The first bomb destroyed The Mulberry Bush just six minutes later. The Tavern was destroyed at 8. 27pm. Conway was not directly involved in the debrief with the England Operational Commander. But he said he was later told “ that the early indications were that the casualties were the result of yet another failure in the warning system, a succession of phone boxes from which the warning might have been relayed having proved to be inoperable. ” In an interview with a national newspaper he described the Birmingham pub bombings as “ a total disaster. ” He added that the secret ‘ Feakle Talks ’, held a couple of weeks after the bombings, were used by the IRA to try to start to repair its image after the Birmingham and the Guildford pub bombings.

 <arg>  detonated or exploded  <arg>  explosive device using  <arg>  to attack  <arg>  target at  <arg>  place US law enforcement and intelligence officials across the country and overseas, scrambling to identify the source of the explosives, are now worried that the marathon sidewalk bombing could mark a new chapter in the struggle to secure the American homeland. Advertisement “ We ’ ve seen this around the world, but what is so concerning about this is that it hadn ’ t happened here, not like this. Until yesterday, ’’ said a senior homeland security official in Washington. The Boston bombs were packed into pressure cookers and hidden in backpacks or duffel bags, according to multiple press accounts citing unidentified sources, another similarity with some Mideast attacks using “ improvised explosive devices, ’’ or IEDs. One of the bombs used in a foiled attack in New York ’ s Times Square in 2010 was fashioned from a pressure cooker. A joint warning issued by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in 2010 said pressure cookers has been used for bombs in multiple  <tgr>  attacks  <tgr>  in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal. Reports from medical staff at Boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with BB ’ s, nails, and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage. That contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in Oklahoma City in 1995 and in the garage of the World Trade Center North Tower in 1993, which were intended to inflict damage on buildings, as well as people. IED ’ s pack a much smaller punch, are cheaper, and easier to carry. They have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan with devastating effect on American troops in convoys of military vehicles. Advertisement No one has taken responsibility for the twin bombings on Boylston Street that killed three people and injured more than 150 near the Boston marathon finish line.

 <arg>  transported  <arg>  in  <arg>  from  <arg>  place to  <arg>  place Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation. The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades, and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured. Of the dead, 14 were tourists. The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness, which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror. Authorities, however, have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country's huge tourism industry. Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests. Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others. The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb. Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two  <tag>  Defendant  </tag>  suspects  <tgr>  arrived  <tgr> , said defense lawyer  <tag>  Participant  </tag>  Chuchart Kanpai. Doubts about motive Early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that  <tag>  Transporter  </tag>  Thailand in July forcibly repatriated more than 100  <tag>  PassengerArtifact  </tag>  Uighurs to  <tag>  Destination  </tag>  China, where it is feared they face persecution. The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists, who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing. But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive, sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang. Still, skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks, contradictions, misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation.

An AFP journalist said eight nearby cars were badly burned and many of the victims of the 9 : 30 am ( 0630 GMT ) attack could not be identified because their papers were inside the offices that were targeted. Two other explosions in the Baghdad neighborhoods of Husseiniyah and Yarmouk killed at least four people and left 24 others wounded, while a car bomb in the town of Tarmiyah, just north of Baghdad, hurt nine people, officials said.

 <arg>  detonated or exploded  <arg>  explosive device using  <arg>  to attack  <arg>  target at  <arg>  place US law enforcement and intelligence officials across the country and overseas, scrambling to identify the source of the explosives, are now worried that the marathon sidewalk bombing could mark a new chapter in the struggle to secure the American homeland. Advertisement “ We ’ ve seen this around the world, but what is so concerning about this is that it hadn ’ t happened here, not like this. Until yesterday, ’’ said a senior homeland security official in Washington. The Boston bombs were packed into pressure cookers and hidden in backpacks or duffel bags, according to multiple press accounts citing unidentified sources, another similarity with some Mideast attacks using “ improvised explosive devices, ’’ or IEDs. One of the bombs used in a foiled attack in New York ’ s Times Square in 2010 was fashioned from a pressure cooker. A joint warning issued by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in 2010 said pressure cookers has been used for bombs in multiple  <tgr>  attacks  <tgr>  in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal. Reports from medical staff at Boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with BB ’ s, nails, and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage. That contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in Oklahoma City in 1995 and in the garage of the World Trade Center North Tower in 1993, which were intended to inflict damage on buildings, as well as people. IED ’ s pack a much smaller punch, are cheaper, and easier to carry. They have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan with devastating effect on American troops in convoys of military vehicles. Advertisement No one has taken responsibility for the twin bombings on Boylston Street that killed three people and injured more than 150 near the Boston marathon finish line.

This device appeared to be similar to a pressure cooker and had wiring on it, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. Pressure cookers were used in the two bombs detonated at the Boston Marathon in 2013. The bomb squad safely removed the second device, New York police tweeted early Sunday. Police officers, firefighters and other first responders had rushed to the scene of the blast, which closed a major roadway and forced people out of nearby buildings. New York Mayor  <tag>  Communicator: Bill de Blasio  </tag>  ( D ) said Sunday that the explosion was “ intentional, ” but noted that few details were available because the investigation was in its early stages. “ We know there was a bombing, ” de Blasio  <tgr>  said  <tgr> . “ We know it was a very serious incident, but we have a lot more work to do to be able to say what kind of motivation was behind this. ” AD AD He also echoed his comments from Saturday night that there was no specific, credible threat against New York from any terrorist group. The FBI and NYPD are trying to understand what motivation lay behind the blast. “ We will look at individuals. We will look at associations. We will look at social media, ” William Sweeney, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI New York Field Office, said. “ Until we have that information it is not fair for us to give a conclusion [ as to motivation ], ” DeBlasio said. “ Let the law enforcement experts draw the conclusions. ”

The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist - inspired group. Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels. The police academy car bombing “ was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [ Cuba acting ] to avoid justice being done ”, Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima.

Abe's administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible. The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium, levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment. The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima, where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns, NHK said. The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities. Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial, service and entertainment use. At a meeting Friday, task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones. It is not clear exactly when the drone landed because workers at the office in central Tokyo rarely go up to the roof. An official taking new employees on a building tour reportedly spotted the drone. A blog with an anti - nuclear theme managed under the name " Kantei ( prime minister's office ) Santa " contained photos of a drone that looked like the one found Wednesday. In one entry, the anonymous writer said he drove from his hometown in Obama city in Fukui to Tokyo and flew the drone in the early hours of April 9, trying to have it land in the yard of the prime minister's office, but that he eventually lost track of the device. In the United States in January, a drone flown by an off - duty intelligence employee  <tgr>  crashed  <tgr>  on the White House grounds.

Bill Richard, whose 8 - year - old son, Martin, was the youngest person killed in the  <tgr>  bombing  <tgr> , said Tsarnaev could have backed out of the plot and reported his brother to authorities. Instead, Richard said, “ he chose hate.  <tag>  Destroyer: He  </tag>  chose destruction.  <tag>  Victim: He  </tag>  chose death. This is all on him. ” Richard noted that his family would have preferred that Tsarnaev receive a life sentence so that he could have had “ a lifetime to reconcile with himself what he did that day. ” Richard said his family has chosen love, kindness and peace, adding : “ That is what makes us different than him. ” Fatima Tlisova of VOA's Russian service contributed to this report from Boston. Some information for this report came from Reuters and AP.

A senior US law enforcement official in Washington added that the fact that no group has taken responsibility has officials speculating that it might not be the work of a well - known international terrorist group like Al Qaeda, Hezbollah or one of its affiliates but a domestic group or individual inspired by the hallmark tactics of terrorist groups in recent years, The Pakistani  <tag>  Attacker: Taliban  </tag>  also  <tgr>  said  <tgr>  in a statement it was not responsible for the attack, unlike the attempted car bombing in New York ’ s Times Square in 2010 that it claimed responsibility for. But officials in Washington have been warning about the possibility of so - called improvised explosive devises in recent weeks. In late february the White House established a new task force housed in the Department of Justice to apply the lessons learned from years of dealing with so - called improvised explosive devices — some large and powerful and others more limited in scope like the ones apparently set off on Boylston Street yesterday. “ The threat from IED use is likely to remain high in the near future, and will continue to evolve in response to our abilities to counter them, ’’ according to a new strategy approved by President Obama on February 26. “ A whole - of - government approach that integrates Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and global participation in counter - IED activities will best position the United States to discover plots to use IEDs in the United States, or against U.

Kieran Conway, who was head of the IRA ’ s intelligence - gathering department in the 1970s, broke a 40 - year silence by the organisation to make the admission. He admitted he was “ appalled and ashamed ” because he claimed the bombing of civilians went against everything it stood for. He said the attacks on The Mulberry Bush and The Tavern in The Town had been in revenge for the death of IRA bomber James McDade. At first he feared that the timing of the attacks - with very little warning - had been deliberate because “ tempers were high ”. But he was later told that the IRA unit involved had tried to use “ a succession of phone boxes ” which were out of order, significantly delaying the bomb - warning call.

S. lawmakers discussed the same trip Tuesday as they raised concerns about the sharing of intelligence among federal law enforcement agencies. Senator Lindsey Graham said the FBI told him it was not aware at the time of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's trip to Russia. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a shootout with police last Thursday, while his younger brother Dzhokhar was captured a day later. Meanwhile, in Boston, authorities on Wednesday reopened Boylston Street, the city thoroughfare where the explosions occurred near the finish line of the race. Later, several thousand people gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a memorial service for campus policeman Sean Collier, who authorities say the Tsarnaev brothers shot to death three days after the bombings. Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano told the Senate Intelligence Committee that her agency did know about Tamerlan's trip, but that an FBI alert on him had expired by the time he returned. The FBI had interviewed Tsarnaev in 2011 at Russia's request, but found nothing to connect him to terrorism at that time. The 19 - year - old Dzhokhar has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction. He is in federal custody in a Boston hospital. U. S. officials say Dzhokhar told them in preliminary interviews that he and his brother were partly motivated by the U. S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but that they were self - radicalized and not connected to any terrorist network. The two suspects are Chechens who came to the United States as boys.

The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades, and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured. Of the dead, 14 were tourists. The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness, which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror. Authorities, however, have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country's huge tourism industry.  <tag>  Jailer Jailer Jailer: Police  </tag>  initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests.

 <arg>  attacked  <arg>  using  <arg>  at  <arg>  place The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher. That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014. The country has since come under frequent US bombardment, in an unreported war that saw 1, 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015. Afghan civilian casualties have been high, with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least  <tag>  Victim: 85  </tag>  deaths in 2016.

Tsarnaev, his chair turned toward the lectern from which the victims spoke, picked at his beard and gazed downward most of the time, only occasionally looking at the speakers. Patricia Campbell, the mother of Krystle Campbell, 29, who was killed in the attack, was the first person to address the court.

 <arg>  identified  <arg>  as  <arg>  at  <arg>  place By MARI YAMAGUCHI, Associated Press TOKYO ( AP ) — Japanese police have arrested a man who admitted to landing a drone with low - level radioactive sand on the roof of the prime minister's office to protest the government's nuclear energy policy, officials said Saturday. Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto, 40, turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan. The small drone  <tgr>  found  <tgr>  Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential  <tag>  Attacker: terrorist  </tag>  attacks using  <tag>  Instrument: unmanned aerial devices  </tag> , the prime ministers'office has said. The infiltration at Japan's political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there. No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident. Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister's office. He has not been indicted and faces further questioning. Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government's nuclear energy policy. Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan's 48 reactors, which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster. Abe's administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible. The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium, levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment. The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima, where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns, NHK said.

S. lawmakers discussed the same trip Tuesday as they raised concerns about the sharing of intelligence among federal law enforcement agencies. Senator Lindsey Graham said the FBI told him it was not aware at the time of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's trip to Russia. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a shootout with police last Thursday, while his younger brother Dzhokhar was captured a day later. Meanwhile, in Boston, authorities on Wednesday reopened Boylston Street, the city thoroughfare where the explosions occurred near the finish line of the race. Later, several thousand people gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a memorial service for campus policeman Sean Collier, who authorities say the Tsarnaev brothers shot to death three days after the bombings. Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano told the Senate Intelligence Committee that her agency did know about Tamerlan's trip, but that an FBI alert on him had expired by the time he returned. The FBI had interviewed Tsarnaev in 2011 at Russia's request, but found nothing to connect him to terrorism at that time. The 19 - year - old Dzhokhar has been  <tgr>  charged  <tgr>  with using a weapon of mass destruction. He is in federal custody in a Boston hospital. U. S. officials say Dzhokhar told them in preliminary interviews that he and his brother were partly motivated by the U. S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but that they were self - radicalized and not connected to any terrorist network. The two suspects are Chechens who came to the United States as boys. The brothers allegedly set off two bombs alongside the Boston Marathon course, killing three people and injuring 264. At least 14 of the wounded lost legs in the blasts.

Colombia has asked Cuba to hand over the rebels affiliated with National Liberation Army ( ELN ), who were in Havana for peace talks, after a deadly car bombing in Bogota was blamed on the group. Conservative President Ivan Duque urged Communist - ruled Cuba, a host and one of the guarantors of the peace process, to send home the ELN rebels in Havana.

The police academy car bombing “ was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [ Cuba acting ] to avoid justice being done ”, Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima. Colombians, including Duque, planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing, the worst such attack in the country in 16 years.

The first drone detonated somewhere above or near the parade, the most likely cause of the casualties announced by the Venezuelan government and pictured on social media. The second drone crashed and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage, and is the most likely cause of the fire which the Venezuelan firefighters described.

 <arg>  died at  <arg>  place from  <arg>  medical issue, killed by  <arg>  killer Reports from medical staff at Boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with BB ’ s, nails, and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage. That contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in Oklahoma City in 1995 and in the garage of the World Trade Center North Tower in 1993, which were intended to inflict damage on buildings, as well as people. IED ’ s pack a much smaller punch, are cheaper, and easier to carry. They have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan with devastating effect on American troops in convoys of military vehicles. Advertisement No one has taken responsibility for the twin bombings on Boylston Street that  <tgr>  killed  <tgr>  three people and injured more than  <tag>  Victim: 150  </tag>  near the Boston marathon finish line. A senior US law enforcement official in Washington added that the fact that no group has taken responsibility has officials speculating that it might not be the work of a well - known international terrorist group like Al Qaeda, Hezbollah or one of its affiliates but a domestic group or individual inspired by the hallmark tactics of terrorist groups in recent years, The Pakistani Taliban also said in a statement it was not responsible for the attack, unlike the attempted car bombing in New York ’ s Times Square in 2010 that it claimed responsibility for. But officials in Washington have been warning about the possibility of so - called improvised explosive devises in recent weeks. In late february the White House established a new task force housed in the Department of Justice to apply the lessons learned from years of dealing with so - called improvised explosive devices — some large and powerful and others more limited in scope like the ones apparently set off on Boylston Street yesterday.

" I heard explosions in the distance so I left my house and I saw a car outside, " said 40 - year - old Taji resident Abu Mohammed, who added that police inspectors concluded the vehicle was a car bomb. " We asked the neighbors to leave their houses, but when they were leaving, the bomb went off. " Abu Mohammed said he witnessed the deaths of an elderly  <tag>  Victim: woman  </tag>  carrying a newborn baby and of the policeman who had first concluded the car was packed with explosives. An Agence France Presse reporter at the scene said a row of houses were completely  <tgr>  destroyed  <tgr> , and residents were rummaging through the rubble in search of victims and their belongings. In Baghdad, meanwhile, a car bomb outside a government office responsible for producing identity papers in the Shiite bastion of Sadr City killed at least 12  <tag>  Victim: people  </tag>  and wounded 22 others, security and medical officials said. " This attack is a terrible crime against humanity, because they did it during Ramadan, while people are fasting, " said one elderly witness who declined to be identified. An AFP journalist said eight nearby cars were badly burned and many of the victims of the 9 : 30 am ( 0630 GMT ) attack could not be identified because their papers were inside the offices that were targeted.

 <arg>  was injured by  <arg>  using  <arg>  in  <arg>  body part with  <arg>  medical issue at  <arg>  place == Background == In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven " incident centres " were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974. == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice: bomb  </tag>  exploded at 9 : 20, injuring 23  <tag>  Victim: civilians  </tag>  and 10 off - duty  <tag>  Victim: soldiers  </tag> .

Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice: bomb  </tag>  in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey. He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds, delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed.

 <arg>  court or judge sentenced  <arg>  for  <arg>  crime to  <arg>  sentence in  <arg>  place == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA  <tag>  Injurer  </tag>  unit exploded a  <tag>  Instrument  </tag>  bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  people. == Aftermath == One of the police  <tag>  Researcher  </tag>  officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a " carbon copy " of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their  <tgr>  sentences  <tgr> . The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street. The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the deaths of nearly 20 people, injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property. == See also == * Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions ( 1970 – 79 ) == References ==

 <arg>  attacked  <arg>  using  <arg>  at  <arg>  place By MARI YAMAGUCHI, Associated Press TOKYO ( AP ) — Japanese police have arrested a man who admitted to landing a drone with low - level radioactive sand on the roof of the prime minister's office to protest the government's nuclear energy policy, officials said Saturday. Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto, 40, turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan. The small  <tag>  IdentifiedObject  </tag>  drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist  <tgr>  attacks  <tgr>  using unmanned aerial devices, the prime ministers'office has said. The infiltration at Japan's political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there. No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident. Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister's office. He has not been indicted and faces further questioning. Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government's nuclear energy policy. Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan's 48 reactors, which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster. Abe's administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible. The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium, levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment. The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima, where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns, NHK said.

 <arg>  detonated or exploded  <arg>  explosive device using  <arg>  to attack  <arg>  target at  <arg>  place The use of drones aligned with Obama ’ s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable, costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia. But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism. The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men, women and children in danger ”. This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case. The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher. That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including  <tag>  Place  </tag>  Afghanistan – where  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  US  <tag>  Instrument  </tag>  air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014. The country has since come under frequent US  <tgr>  bombardment  <tgr> , in an unreported war that saw 1, 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015. Afghan civilian casualties have been high, with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  85 deaths in 2016. The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period. We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015.

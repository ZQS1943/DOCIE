 <arg>  was injured by  <arg>  using  <arg>  in  <arg>  body part with  <arg>  medical issue at  <arg>  place On 27 August 1975 a Provisional IRA bomb exploded without warning at the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey, England. There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured, some severely. Two off - duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing. == Background == In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven " incident centres " were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974. == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice  </tag>  bomb exploded at 9 : 20, injuring 23  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  civilians and 10 off - duty  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the  <tgr>  injuries  <tgr>  were very serious, with at least three  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the  <tag>  Artifact  </tag>  roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people. == Aftermath ==

Read our docudrama minute - by - minute recreation of the events of November 21 1974 The Birmingham Mail received an ambiguous call at 8. 11pm on November 21. The caller did not identify either pub, referring instead to The Rotunda, above The Mulberry Bush and the New Street Tax Office, which was above the underground Tavern in The Town. The first bomb destroyed The Mulberry Bush just six minutes later. The Tavern was destroyed at 8. 27pm. Conway was not directly involved in the debrief with the England Operational Commander.

" I heard explosions in the distance so I left my house and I saw a car outside, " said 40 - year - old Taji resident Abu Mohammed, who added that police inspectors concluded the vehicle was a car bomb. " We asked the neighbors to leave their houses, but when they were leaving, the bomb went off. " Abu Mohammed said he witnessed the deaths of an elderly  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  woman carrying a newborn baby and of the  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  policeman who had first concluded the car was packed with explosives. An Agence France Presse reporter at the scene said a row of houses were completely  <tgr>  destroyed  <tgr> , and residents were rummaging through the rubble in search of victims and their belongings. In Baghdad, meanwhile, a car bomb outside a government office responsible for producing identity papers in the Shiite bastion of Sadr City killed at least 12 people and wounded 22 others, security and medical officials said. " This attack is a terrible crime against humanity, because they did it during Ramadan, while people are fasting, " said one elderly witness who declined to be identified. An AFP journalist said eight nearby cars were badly burned and many of the victims of the 9 : 30 am ( 0630 GMT ) attack could not be identified because their papers were inside the offices that were targeted. Two other explosions in the Baghdad neighborhoods of Husseiniyah and Yarmouk killed at least four people and left 24 others wounded, while a car bomb in the town of Tarmiyah, just north of Baghdad, hurt nine people, officials said.

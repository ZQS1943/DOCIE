I did do it along with my brother -- I learned of some of the victims. I learned their names, their faces, their age. And throughout this trial more of those victims were given names, more of those victims had faces, and they had burdened souls. Now, all those who got up on that witness stand and that podium related to us -- to me -- I was listening -- the suffering that was and the hardship that still is, with strength and with patience and with dignity. Now, Allah says in the Qur ’ an that no soul is burdened with more than it can bear, and you told us just how unbearable it was, how horrendous it was, this thing I put you through. And I know that you kept that much. I know that there isn ’ t enough time in the day for you to have related to us everything. I also wish that far more people had a chance to get up there, but I took them from you.

Here ’ s its conclusion : From the open sources of information available, it appears that an attack took place using two DBIEDs while Maduro was giving a speech. Both the drones appear visually similar to DJI Matrice 600s, with at least one displaying features that are consistent with this model. These drones appear to have been loaded with explosive and flown towards the parade. The first drone  <tgr>  detonated  <tgr>  somewhere above or near the parade, the most likely cause of the casualties announced by the  <tag>  Communicator  </tag>  Venezuelan government and pictured on social media. The second  <tag>  Vehicle  </tag>  drone crashed and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage, and is the most likely cause of the fire which the Venezuelan firefighters described. It also considers the claim of attribution by a group on social media, calling itself " Soldados de Franelas " ( aka ‘ T - Shirt Soldiers ’ — a reference to a technique used by protestors wrapping a t - shirt around their head to cover their face and protect their identity ), suggesting it ’ s not clear from the group ’ s Twitter messages that they are " unequivocally claiming responsibility for the event ", owing to use of passive language, and to a claim that the drones were shot down by government snipers — which it says " does not appear to be supported by the open source information available ".

The FBI still has no determination as to motive, said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing. Agents are examining the detonated material from the first device as well as studying the second, which appeared to resemble a pressure cooker. They are also looking at video from security cameras, social media — “ all the logical leads, ” the official said. The explosion in Chelsea coincided with a separate attack that took place in Minnesota Saturday night, in which a  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  man stabbed eight people in a St. Cloud mall before he was killed by an off - duty police  <tag>  Killer  </tag>  officer. On Sunday, an ISIS - linked news agency  <tgr>  claimed  <tgr>  the mall attacker was “ a soldier of the Islamic State. ” An FBI  <tag>  Communicator  </tag>  spokesman said in an emailed statement that the agency had not determined whether the stabbings were related to the bombing in Manhattan the same night. Speaking to CNN ’ s Jake Tapper on Sunday morning, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ( R ) said there were no known links so far between the incident in New Jersey and those in New York and Minnesota. Authorities urged any witnesses with tips, video or other credible information about the explosion to call 1 - 800 - 577 - TIPS. Berman and Wang reported from Washington. Renae Merle in New York and Karen DeYoung, Ellen Nakashima, Steven Overly and Sari Horwitz in Washington contributed to this report. [ This is a developing story.

I started running. too, ” said Schulman, 26, who has lived in the neighborhood since 2014. Two blocks from the blast scene, a group of people emerged from a screening of the animated movie “ Beauty and the Beast ” and saw the flashing lights. One man who came out of the theater said he could not hear anything and had no idea about the explosion not far from where he was sitting. President Obama was briefed on the situation in New York and will be updated as more information becomes available, a White House official said late Saturday. Speaking in Colorado not long after the explosion, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump quickly commented on the situation before much information was known. “ I must tell you that just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what ’ s going on, ”  <tgr>  said  <tgr>  Trump shortly after getting off of his plane. His comments were made before authorities confirmed the nature of the explosion. Late Saturday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said it was important to “ know the facts ” before drawing conclusions about such incidents. Early Sunday, posts on social media from people in New York showed the area of the explosion to be relatively calm and quiet. Authorities had closed large swaths of roads in the area Saturday night. On Sunday, several roads had reopened but there remained a large police presence in the area. The explosion in New York comes as foreign leaders, including many heads of state, are heading to Manhattan for the United Nations General Assembly. Secretary of State John F. Kerry arrived Saturday, while Obama is scheduled to head to the city on Monday.

The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government.

AD The New York Police Department ’ s counterterrorism bureau responded to the explosion, along with officials with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. While O ’ Neill said authorities were still trying to determine what, precisely, exploded, the NYPD counterterrorism bureau posted a photo online earlier Saturday showing what appeared to be a dumpster or garbage container mangled by a blast : Police in New York also reported shortly after 11 p. m. that they had found the “ possible secondary device ” a few blocks away from the Chelsea explosion scene, on 27th Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues. Police directed people away from that intersection, and one officer could be heard telling pedestrians that “ there is a possible explosive ” in the area. AD Not long after midnight, police  <tgr>  said  <tgr>  in a statement that they were asking people in the area of this potential explosive to move away from their windows “ until we clear the suspicious package, ” although officers did not fully evacuate the area. AD According to the Associated Press, the second device was removed with a robot and taken to the department firing range in the Bronx. O ’ Neill said Sunday that two “ very dedicated ” former New York state troopers had responded to the initial report of the blast last night. In a search for other explosives, they had parked their vehicle on 27th Street. Walking down the block, they found the second, unexploded device, O ’ Neill said. AD Reports of another suspicious package at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue turned out to be a false alarm — the package was only garbage, J. Peter Donald, a police spokesman, posted on Twitter around 12 : 30 a. m. Sunday.

Birmingham pub bombings : Minute by minute - 24 hours that changed our city forever Funding for the terrorists dried up almost overnight and the bombings, which left 21 dead and almost 200 injured, including many maimed for life, cost them hugely in the propaganda war.

Julie said : “ I am expecting West Midlands Police Chief Constable Chris Sims and West Midlands Police Force to interview with Mr Conway with immediate effect. “ And I hope that Mr Cameron, who a week ago told The House of Commons that the pub bombers must be found, takes note of this development and ensures that the police follow this through. ” Brian added : “ The police keep saying they won ’ t do anything because there is no fresh evidence. Well, here it is in black and white. It ’ s an admission.

Insurgents also launched attacks on a military base near the town of Dhuluiyah, killing at least 15 Iraqi soldiers and leaving two others wounded, according to two security officials. Two other attacks in the same province -- a shooting at a checkpoint and a car bomb near a Shiite mosque -- left three people dead and six wounded, officials said. Nine bomb blasts, some of them minutes apart, meanwhile killed seven people and wounded 29 in Kirkuk city and the eponymous province's towns of Dibis and Tuz Khurmatu. Three different attacks -- a car  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice  </tag>  bomb, a roadside blast and a shooting -- in the main northern city of Mosul and the nearby town of Baaj left nine people  <tgr>  dead  <tgr>  and seven wounded, according to Iraqi army First Lieutenant Waad Mohammed and police Lieutenant Mohammed al - Juburi. A roadside bomb at a market in the center of the town of Diwaniyah, south of Baghdad, killed three people and left 25 hurt, provincial health chief Adnan Turki said. In the western town of Heet, a car bomb exploded near an army patrol, killing one soldier and wounding 10 others, according to an Iraqi army captain and doctor Abdulwahab al - Shammari from the town hospital.

 <arg>  died at  <arg>  place from  <arg>  medical issue, killed by  <arg>  killer Reports from medical staff at Boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with BB ’ s, nails, and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage. That contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in Oklahoma City in 1995 and in the garage of the World Trade Center North Tower in 1993, which were intended to inflict damage on buildings, as well as people. IED ’ s pack a much smaller punch, are cheaper, and easier to carry. They have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan with devastating effect on American troops in convoys of military vehicles. Advertisement No one has taken responsibility for the twin bombings on Boylston Street that  <tgr>  killed  <tgr>  three people and injured  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  more than 150 near the Boston marathon finish line. A senior US law enforcement official in Washington added that the fact that no group has taken responsibility has officials speculating that it might not be the work of a well - known international terrorist group like Al Qaeda, Hezbollah or one of its affiliates but a domestic group or individual inspired by the hallmark tactics of terrorist groups in recent years, The Pakistani Taliban also said in a statement it was not responsible for the attack, unlike the attempted car bombing in New York ’ s Times Square in 2010 that it claimed responsibility for. But officials in Washington have been warning about the possibility of so - called improvised explosive devises in recent weeks. In late february the White House established a new task force housed in the Department of Justice to apply the lessons learned from years of dealing with so - called improvised explosive devices — some large and powerful and others more limited in scope like the ones apparently set off on Boylston Street yesterday.

 <arg>  met face-to-face with  <arg>  about  <arg>  topic at  <arg>  place His comments were made before authorities confirmed the nature of the explosion. Late Saturday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said it was important to “ know the facts ” before drawing conclusions about such incidents. Early Sunday, posts on social media from people in New York showed the area of the explosion to be relatively calm and quiet. Authorities had closed large swaths of roads in the area Saturday night. On Sunday, several roads had reopened but there remained a large police presence in the area. The explosion in New York comes as foreign leaders, including many heads of state, are heading to Manhattan for the United Nations General Assembly. Secretary of State John F. Kerry arrived Saturday, while Obama is scheduled to head to the city on Monday. This annual  <tgr>  meeting  <tgr>  — held more than two miles from the site of the explosion in Chelsea — is traditionally a challenging time for New York, as many roads are shut down and the heavy security leads to traffic jams. The FBI still has no determination as to motive, said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing. Agents are examining the detonated material from the first device as well as studying the second, which appeared to resemble a pressure cooker. They are also looking at video from security cameras, social media — “ all the logical leads, ” the official said. The explosion in Chelsea coincided with a separate attack that took place in Minnesota Saturday night, in which a man stabbed eight people in a St. Cloud mall before he was killed by an off - duty police officer. On Sunday, an ISIS - linked news agency claimed the mall attacker was “ a soldier of the Islamic State. ”

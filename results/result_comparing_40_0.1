AD Not long after midnight, police said in a statement that they were asking people in the area of this potential explosive to move away from their windows “ until we clear the suspicious package, ” although officers did not fully evacuate the area. AD According to the Associated Press, the second device was removed with a robot and taken to the department firing range in the Bronx. O ’ Neill said Sunday that two “ very dedicated ” former New York state troopers had responded to the initial report of the blast last night. In a search for other explosives, they had parked their vehicle on 27th Street. Walking down the block, they found the second, unexploded device, O ’ Neill  <tgr>  said  <tgr> . AD Reports of another suspicious package at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue turned out to be a false alarm — the package was only garbage, J. Peter Donald, a police spokesman, posted on Twitter around 12 : 30 a. m. Sunday. The Chelsea explosion occurred about 11 hours after a pipe bomb exploded in a Jersey Shore garbage can, shortly before a scheduled charity 5K race there benefiting Marines and Navy sailors. AD Authorities have said they have not yet found anything connecting the Chelsea and New Jersey incidents but are continuing to investigate. On Sunday, Cuomo said the “ bombs ” in Chelsea “ appear to be different ” from those discovered earlier in the day in New Jersey, though the devices from both states were being shipped to the FBI lab in Quantico for further assessment. He said the devices in New Jersey were “ pipe bombs, ” and those in Chelsea were not. Cuomo said agents in New York were in touch with those in New Jersey. AD

 <arg>  died at  <arg>  place from  <arg>  medical issue, killed by  <arg>  killer The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men, women and children in danger ”. This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case. The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher. That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014. The country has since come under frequent US bombardment, in an unreported war that saw 1, 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015. Afghan civilian casualties have been high, with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least 85  <tgr>  deaths  <tgr>  in 2016. The Bureau recorded 65 to 105  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  civilian deaths during this period. We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015. Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama ’ s first term. The pace of attacks had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of Bush ’ s term, after four years pocked by occasional strikes. However in the year after taking office, Obama ordered more drone strikes than Bush did during his entire presidency. The 54 strikes in 2009 all took place in Pakistan.

 <arg>  charged or indicted  <arg>  before  <arg>  court or judge for  <arg>  crime in  <arg>  place Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation. The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades, and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured. Of the dead, 14 were tourists. The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness, which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror. Authorities, however, have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country's huge tourism industry. Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests. Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others. The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb. Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the  <tgr>  indictments  <tgr>  took place before the two  <tag>  PassengerArtifact  </tag>  suspects arrived, said defense lawyer  <tag>  Participant  </tag>  Chuchart Kanpai. Doubts about motive Early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that Thailand in July forcibly repatriated more than 100 Uighurs to China, where it is feared they face persecution. The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists, who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing. But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive, sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang. Still, skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks, contradictions, misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation.

 <arg>  court or judge sentenced  <arg>  for  <arg>  crime to  <arg>  sentence in  <arg>  place == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people. == Aftermath == One of the police  <tag>  Researcher  </tag>  officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a " carbon copy " of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their  <tgr>  sentences  <tgr> .

The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the deaths of nearly 20 people, injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property. == See also == * Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions ( 1970 – 79 ) == References ==

 <arg>  communicated to  <arg>  about  <arg>  topic using  <arg>  at  <arg>  place (one-way communication) This annual meeting — held more than two miles from the site of the explosion in Chelsea — is traditionally a challenging time for New York, as many roads are shut down and the heavy security leads to traffic jams. The FBI still has no determination as to motive, said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing. Agents are examining the detonated material from the first device as well as studying the second, which appeared to resemble a pressure cooker. They are also looking at video from security cameras, social media — “ all the logical leads, ” the official said. The explosion in Chelsea coincided with a separate attack that took place in Minnesota Saturday night, in which a man stabbed eight people in a St. Cloud mall before  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  he was killed by an off - duty police  <tag>  Killer  </tag>  officer. On Sunday, an ISIS - linked news  <tag>  Communicator  </tag>  agency claimed the mall  <tag>  Topic  </tag>  attacker was “ a soldier of the Islamic State. ” An FBI spokesman  <tgr>  said  <tgr>  in an emailed statement that the agency had not determined whether the stabbings were related to the bombing in Manhattan the same night. Speaking to CNN ’ s Jake Tapper on Sunday morning, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ( R ) said there were no known links so far between the incident in New Jersey and those in New York and Minnesota. Authorities urged any witnesses with tips, video or other credible information about the explosion to call 1 - 800 - 577 - TIPS. Berman and Wang reported from Washington. Renae Merle in New York and Karen DeYoung, Ellen Nakashima, Steven Overly and Sari Horwitz in Washington contributed to this report. [ This is a developing story.

 <arg>  communicated to  <arg>  about  <arg>  topic using  <arg>  at  <arg>  place (one-way communication) “ A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism, but it ’ s not linked to international terrorism. In other words, we find no ISIS connections. ” AD He said later : “ This is the nightmare scenario. ” Not long after the blast, police said they had found another possible explosive device just blocks away. This device appeared to be similar to a pressure cooker and had wiring on it, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. Pressure cookers were used in the two bombs detonated at the Boston Marathon in 2013. The bomb squad safely removed the second device, New York police tweeted early Sunday. Police officers, firefighters and other first responders had rushed to the scene of the blast, which closed a major roadway and forced people out of nearby buildings. New York Mayor  <tag>  Communicator  </tag>  Bill de Blasio ( D ) said Sunday that the explosion was “ intentional, ” but noted that few details were available because the investigation was in its early stages. “ We know there was a bombing, ” de Blasio  <tgr>  said  <tgr> . “ We know it was a very serious incident, but we have a lot more work to do to be able to say what kind of motivation was behind this. ” AD AD He also echoed his comments from Saturday night that there was no specific, credible threat against New York from any terrorist group. The FBI and NYPD are trying to understand what motivation lay behind the blast. “ We will look at individuals. We will look at associations. We will look at social media, ” William Sweeney, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI New York Field Office, said. “ Until we have that information it is not fair for us to give a conclusion [ as to motivation ], ” DeBlasio said.

There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured, some severely. Two off - duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing. == Background == In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven " incident centres " were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London.

 <arg>  was injured by  <arg>  using  <arg>  in  <arg>  body part with  <arg>  medical issue at  <arg>  place " Yes, sir, " Rahimi said. Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U. S. citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Sept. 17. It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people. The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey, although that detonation did not injure anyone. Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey.  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police  <tag>  Jailer  </tag>  officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left him with several gunshot  <tgr>  wounds  <tgr> , delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed. Assistant U. S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi's movements on the day of the bombings, including leaving his house carrying bags, walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street. He also said the government has records showing Rahimi purchased bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs. Lewin asked Berman to consider a trial date in the " late winter " or " early spring, " saying the amount of evidence in the case is relatively limited. Berman scheduled court dates for Dec. 19 and Jan. 31 but has not set a trial date. Rahimi's court - appointed defense lawyers declined to comment after the hearing.

Wearing a dark blue jump suit, Rahimi, 28, shuffled slowly into federal court in Manhattan and had several coughing fits during the brief hearing. He suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing. He spoke only once, when U. S. District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday. " Yes, sir, " Rahimi said. Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U. S.  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan's  <tag>  Place  </tag>  Chelsea neighborhood on Sept. 17. It did not kill  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  anyone but  <tgr>  hurt  <tgr>  30 people. The attack came hours after authorities say  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice  </tag>  another pipe bomb planted by  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey, although that detonation did not injure  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  anyone. Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey. He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds, delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed.

S. officials in recent months, but last week threatened to suspend the fledgling process, lambasting Washington for changing the agenda of the talks and " unilaterally " adding new subjects. The insurgents have long refused to hold direct talks with the Kabul government -- despite U. S. pleas -- which the Taliban dismisses as a puppet of Washington. In recent years the Afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures. Last year Ghani has said 28, 000 Afghan police officers and soldiers have been killed since 2015, breaking the longstanding suppression on casualty data. Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline terrorist group said they have killed 190 people in the complex attack. Last week, Taliban  <tag>  Injurer Injurer  </tag>  fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  people and wounding more than 110  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  Afghans and expatriates in the capital, Kabul. On Sunday, a suicide bombing in the southeastern province of  <tag>  Place  </tag>  Logar left eight policemen  <tgr>  dead  <tgr>  and another  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  10 wounded.

The provincial governor and spy chief traveling in the convoy were unharmed. The Taliban have ramped up their attacks on security forces and government facilities in recent months, while Afghan and U. S. troops have increased operations against the militants'field commanders. Military sources say around 35 members of the country's security forces are killed every day in attacks and clashes. This is while the U. S. is still considering a significant troop drawdown in Afghanistan. Around 14, 000 U. S. troops are stationed in the country, coupled with around 7, 500 troops from other allied nations, according to RAND, a U. S. government research organization.

 <arg>  died at  <arg>  place from  <arg>  medical issue, killed by  <arg>  killer The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men, women and children in danger ”. This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case. The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher. That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014. The country has since come under frequent US bombardment, in an unreported war that saw 1, 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015. Afghan civilian casualties have been high, with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  85 deaths in 2016. The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian  <tgr>  deaths  <tgr>  during this period. We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015. Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama ’ s first term. The pace of attacks had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of Bush ’ s term, after four years pocked by occasional strikes. However in the year after taking office, Obama ordered more drone strikes than Bush did during his entire presidency. The 54 strikes in 2009 all took place in Pakistan.

The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people. == Aftermath == One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a " carbon copy " of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences. The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street. The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the deaths of nearly 20  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  people,  <tgr>  injured  <tgr>  hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to  <tag>  Artifact  </tag>  property. == See also == * Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions ( 1970 – 79 ) == References ==

 <arg>  attacked  <arg>  using  <arg>  at  <arg>  place On 27 August 1975 a Provisional IRA bomb exploded without warning at the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey, England. There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured, some severely. Two off - duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing. == Background == In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven " incident centres " were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out  <tag>  Instrument  </tag>  bomb and gun attacks in Southern  <tag>  Place  </tag>  England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an  <tgr>  assassination  <tgr>  attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  attackers threw a  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice  </tag>  bomb into  <tag>  Target  </tag>  his bedroom window on 22 December 1974. == The bombing == The  <tag>  ManufacturerAssembler  </tag>  Balcombe Street Gang planted a time  <tag>  Artifact  </tag>  bomb in the Caterham Arms public  <tag>  Place  </tag>  house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people. == Aftermath ==

 <arg>  arrested or jailed  <arg>  for  <arg>  crime at  <arg>  place The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last May, when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government. Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang said before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage, witnesses, DNA matching and physical evidence, in addition to their confessions. Security camera footage from the Erawan Shrine showed a man wearing a yellow T - shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine, took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away. Time stamps on closed circuit TV footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred, during evening rush hour as the area in central Bangkok was filled with people. Police believe that Bilal is the yellow - shirted man who planted the bomb and  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  Yusufu is believed to have detonated the  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice  </tag>  bomb. Bilal, was initially identified as Adem Karadag, which was the name on a fake Turkish passport in his possession when  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  he was arrested Aug. 29. He was  <tgr>  arrested  <tgr>  at one of two apartments police raided on the outskirts of Bangkok.  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  Yusufu was arrested Sept. 1 near the Thai - Cambodia border, carrying a Chinese passport indicating he was from Xinjiang.  <tag>  Participant  </tag>  Police said his DNA and fingerprints were found in both raided apartments, including on a container of gunpowder. Police said they have confessions from the two, and Bilal's lawyer says his client admitted planting the deadly bomb at the behest of another suspect who remains a fugitive. He says Bilal was induced to carry out the action by a promise that his emigration to Turkey would be expedited. Some material for this report came from AP.

 <arg>  court or judge sentenced  <arg>  for  <arg>  crime to  <arg>  sentence in  <arg>  place == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people. == Aftermath == One of the police  <tag>  Researcher  </tag>  officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a " carbon copy " of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their  <tgr>  sentences  <tgr> . The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street. The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the deaths of nearly 20 people, injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property. == See also == * Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions ( 1970 – 79 ) == References ==

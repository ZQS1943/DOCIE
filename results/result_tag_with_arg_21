Wearing a dark blue jump suit, Rahimi, 28, shuffled slowly into federal court in Manhattan and had several coughing fits during the brief hearing. He suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing. He spoke only once, when U. S. District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday. " Yes, sir, " Rahimi said. Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U. S. citizen of  <tgr>  setting off  <tgr>  an explosion in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Sept. 17. It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people. The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice: bomb  </tag>  planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey, although that detonation did not injure anyone. Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey. He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds, delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed.

Security camera footage from the Erawan Shrine showed a man wearing a yellow T - shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine, took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away. Time stamps on closed circuit TV footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred, during evening rush hour as the area in central Bangkok was filled with people. Police believe that Bilal is the yellow - shirted man who planted the bomb and Yusufu is believed to have detonated the bomb. Bilal, was initially identified as Adem Karadag, which was the name on a fake Turkish passport in his possession when he was arrested Aug. 29. He was arrested at one of two apartments police raided on the outskirts of Bangkok. Yusufu was arrested Sept. 1 near the Thai - Cambodia border, carrying a Chinese passport indicating he was from Xinjiang. Police said his DNA and fingerprints were found in both raided apartments, including on a container of gunpowder. Police said they have confessions from the two, and Bilal's lawyer says his client admitted planting the deadly bomb at the behest of another suspect who remains a fugitive. He  <tgr>  says  <tgr>  Bilal was induced to carry out the action by a promise that his emigration to Turkey would be expedited. Some material for this report came from AP.

Two blocks from the blast scene, a group of people emerged from a screening of the animated movie “ Beauty and the Beast ” and saw the flashing lights. One man who came out of the theater said he could not hear anything and had no idea about the explosion not far from where he was sitting. President Obama was briefed on the situation in New York and will be updated as more information becomes available, a White House official said late Saturday. Speaking in Colorado not long after the explosion, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump quickly commented on the situation before much information was known. “ I must tell you that just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what ’ s going on, ”  <tgr>  said  <tgr>  Trump shortly after getting off of his plane. His comments were made before authorities confirmed the nature of the explosion. Late Saturday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said it was important to “ know the facts ” before drawing conclusions about such incidents. Early Sunday, posts on social media from people in New York showed the area of the explosion to be relatively calm and quiet. Authorities had closed large swaths of roads in the area Saturday night. On Sunday, several roads had reopened but there remained a large police presence in the area. The explosion in New York comes as foreign leaders, including many heads of state, are heading to Manhattan for the United Nations General Assembly. Secretary of State John F. Kerry arrived Saturday, while Obama is scheduled to head to the city on Monday.

 <arg>  communicated to  <arg>  about  <arg>  topic using  <arg>  at  <arg>  place (one-way communication) This annual meeting — held more than two miles from the site of the explosion in Chelsea — is traditionally a challenging time for New York, as many roads are shut down and the heavy security leads to traffic jams. The FBI still has no determination as to motive, said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing. Agents are examining the detonated material from the first device as well as studying the second, which appeared to resemble a pressure cooker. They are also looking at video from security cameras, social media — “ all the logical leads, ” the official said. The explosion in Chelsea coincided with a separate attack that took place in Minnesota Saturday night, in which a man stabbed eight people in a St. Cloud mall before he was killed by an off - duty police  <tag>  Victim: officer  </tag> . On Sunday, an ISIS - linked news  <tag>  Communicator: agency  </tag>  claimed the  <tag>  Recipient: mall  </tag>  attacker was “ a soldier of the Islamic State. ” An FBI spokesman  <tgr>  said  <tgr>  in an emailed statement that the  <tag>  Attacker: agency  </tag>  had not determined whether the stabbings were related to the bombing in  <tag>  Place: Manhattan  </tag>  the same night. Speaking to CNN ’ s Jake Tapper on Sunday morning, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ( R ) said there were no known links so far between the incident in New Jersey and those in New York and Minnesota. Authorities urged any witnesses with tips, video or other credible information about the explosion to call 1 - 800 - 577 - TIPS. Berman and Wang reported from Washington. Renae Merle in New York and Karen DeYoung, Ellen Nakashima, Steven Overly and Sari Horwitz in Washington contributed to this report. [ This is a developing story.

AD Reports of another suspicious package at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue turned out to be a false alarm — the package was only garbage, J.

The Chelsea explosion occurred about 11 hours after a pipe bomb exploded in a Jersey Shore garbage can, shortly before a scheduled charity 5K race there benefiting Marines and Navy sailors.

 <arg>  communicated with  <arg>  about  <arg>  topic at  <arg>  place (document does not specify in person or not, or one-way or not) A Bangkok military court has indicted two men accused of carrying out the August 17 bombing at a popular shrine that killed 20 people. The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast, including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder. Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror, and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism. Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and  <tag>  Detainee: Mieraili  </tag>  have been detained. They are described as ethnic Uighurs, a minority group based in China's Xinjiang region.  <tag>  Detainee: They  </tag>  have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September. Thai officials have  <tgr>  said  <tgr>  the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling  <tag>  Attacker: gang  </tag>  seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation. The August 17 blast at the  <tag>  Target: Erawan Shrine  </tag>  - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in  <tag>  Place: Bangkok  </tag>  in decades, and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured. Of the dead, 14 were tourists. The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness, which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror. Authorities, however, have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country's huge tourism industry. Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests. Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others.

However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher. That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014. The country has since come under frequent US bombardment, in an unreported war that saw 1, 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015. Afghan civilian casualties have been high, with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least  <tag>  Victim: 85  </tag>  deaths in 2016. The Bureau recorded 65 to 105  <tag>  Victim: civilian  </tag>  deaths during this period. We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015.

 <arg>  attacked  <arg>  using  <arg>  at  <arg>  place Analysis backs claim drones were used to  <tgr>  attack  <tgr>  Venezuela ’ s president Analysis of open source information carried out by the investigative website Bellingcat suggests  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice: drones  </tag>  that had been repurposed as flying bombs were indeed used in an attack on the  <tag>  Target: president  </tag>  of Venezuela this weekend. The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate President  <tag>  Target: Nicolás Maduro  </tag>  using two  <tag>  Instrument: drones  </tag>  loaded with explosives. The president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred. Initial video from a state - owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro, those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera. But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions. AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim — suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat. Since then more footage has emerged, including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building. Bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack, including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech, and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up. The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s, each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and, when detonated, capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters.

A total of 563  <tgr>  strikes  <tgr> , largely by drones, targeted Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen during Obama ’ s two terms, compared to 57 strikes under  <tag>  Attacker: Bush  </tag> . Between 384 and 807  <tag>  Victim: civilians  </tag>  were killed in those  <tag>  Place: countries  </tag> , according to reports logged by the Bureau. The use of drones aligned with Obama ’ s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable, costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia. But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism. The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men, women and children in danger ”. This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case. The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data.

" I have been in touch with the NDS official in the province and they told me that over 100 members of the NDS were killed in the big explosion, " the former provincial official said. Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak said  <tag>  Identifier: he  </tag>  saw bodies of 35 Afghan forces in the  <tag>  Place: hospital  </tag> . " Many more were killed. Several  <tag>  PassengerArtifact: bodies  </tag>  were transported to  <tag>  Destination: Kabul  </tag>  city and many injured were  <tgr>  transferred  <tgr>  to hospitals in Kabul, " said Hotak, adding that " the government was hiding the accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in the morale of the Afghan forces. " " The explosion was very powerful. The whole building has collapsed, " he said. Government officials in Maidan Wardak and Kabul declined to comment when asked if they were obscuring the death toll. Two senior officials in the interior ministry said the exact casualty figures were not being disclosed to prevent unrest within the armed forces. " I have been told not to make the death toll figures public. It is frustrating to hide the facts, " said a senior interior ministry official in Kabul. A senior NDS official in Kabul said at least 50 people were killed or wounded in the complex attack.

He suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing. He spoke only once, when U. S. District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday. " Yes, sir, " Rahimi said. Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U. S.  <tag>  Attacker: citizen  </tag>  of setting off an explosion in Manhattan's  <tag>  Place: Chelsea  </tag>  neighborhood on Sept. 17. It did not kill  <tag>  Victim: anyone  </tag>  but hurt 30  <tag>  Victim: people  </tag> .

In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey. He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds, delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed.

On Sunday, Cuomo said the “ bombs ” in Chelsea “ appear to be different ” from those discovered earlier in the day in New Jersey, though the devices from both states were being shipped to the FBI lab in Quantico for further assessment. He said the devices in New Jersey were “ pipe bombs, ” and those in Chelsea were not. Cuomo said agents in New York were in touch with those in New Jersey. AD Cuomo said officials “ have no reason to believe at this time that there is any further immediate threat, ” though the National Guard and the New York State Police were deploying an additional 1, 000 personnel to bus terminals, airports and subways “ just to err on the side of caution. ” AD Cuomo  <tgr>  said  <tgr>  the blast in Chelsea “ caused significant property damage, ” though he a nearby subway station was structurally safe.  <tag>  Communicator: He  </tag>  said law enforcement would work diligently to identify and locate those responsible. “ Whoever placed these bombs, we will find, and they will be brought to justice, ” Cuomo said. The explosion in the area of 23rd Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues occurred about 8 : 30 p. m. police said. Several of those injured were brought to area hospitals, Donald, the police spokesman, posted on Twitter. AD All victims were treated and released by Sunday morning, Cuomo said. A spokeswoman for Lenox Health Greenwich Village, which treated nine of the victims, said patients were treated for minor injuries that included lacerations to the head and body. Other hospitals declined to provide specifics about the extent of patients ’ injuries from the explosion. AD

 <arg>  arrested or jailed  <arg>  for  <arg>  crime at  <arg>  place == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a  <tag>  Subject: bomb  </tag>  in Oxford Street, injuring several people. == Aftermath == One of the police  <tag>  Researcher: officers  </tag>  in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a " carbon copy " of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four  <tag>  Defendant: people  </tag>  were already serving their sentences.

The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists, who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing. But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive, sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang. Still, skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks, contradictions, misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation. The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last May, when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government. Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang said before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage, witnesses, DNA matching and physical evidence, in addition to their confessions.

The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast, including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder. Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror, and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism. Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been  <tgr>  detained  <tgr> . They are described as ethnic Uighurs, a minority group based in China's Xinjiang region.  <tag>  Detainee: They  </tag>  have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September. Thai  <tag>  Participant: officials  </tag>  have said the blast was carried out by a  <tag>  Attacker: people  </tag>  - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation. The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades, and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured. Of the dead, 14 were tourists. The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness, which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror. Authorities, however, have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country's huge tourism industry. Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests. Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others.

Wearing a dark blue jump suit, Rahimi, 28, shuffled slowly into federal court in Manhattan and had several coughing fits during the brief hearing. He suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing. He spoke only once, when U. S. District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday. " Yes, sir, " Rahimi said. Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U. S.  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan's  <tag>  Place  </tag>  Chelsea neighborhood on Sept. 17. It did not  <tgr>  kill  <tgr>  anyone but hurt 30  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  people. The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice  </tag>  bomb planted by  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in  <tag>  Place  </tag>  New Jersey, although that detonation did not injure  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  anyone. Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey.

Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey. He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds, delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed.

They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September.

But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism. The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men, women and children in danger ”. This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case. The  <tag>  Killer  </tag>  White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of  <tag>  Victim Victim  </tag>  people killed in  <tag>  Instrument  </tag>  drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data.

Before the truce, the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London.

 <arg>  arrested or jailed  <arg>  for  <arg>  crime at  <arg>  place By MARI YAMAGUCHI, Associated Press TOKYO ( AP ) — Japanese police have arrested a man who admitted to landing a drone with low - level radioactive sand on the roof of the prime minister's office to protest the government's nuclear energy policy, officials said Saturday. Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto, 40, turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan. The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices, the prime ministers'office has said. The infiltration at Japan's political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there. No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident. Police said  <tag>  Perpetrator  </tag>  Yamamoto was  <tgr>  arrested  <tgr>  on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister's  <tag>  Place  </tag>  office. He has not been indicted and faces further questioning. Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government's nuclear energy policy. Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan's 48 reactors, which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster. Abe's administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible. The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium, levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment. The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima, where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns, NHK said.
output:
 <arg>  arrested or jailed Yamamoto for  <arg>  crime at  <arg>  place

He suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing. He spoke only once, when U. S. District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday. " Yes, sir, " Rahimi said. Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U. S.  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan's Chelsea  <tag>  Place  </tag>  neighborhood on Sept. 17. It did not kill  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  anyone but hurt 30  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  people. The  <tgr>  attack  <tgr>  came hours after authorities say another pipe  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice  </tag>  bomb planted by  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in  <tag>  Place  </tag>  New Jersey, although that detonation did not injure  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  anyone.

In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey. He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds, delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed.

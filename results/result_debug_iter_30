Birmingham pub bombings : Minute by minute - 24 hours that changed our city forever Funding for the terrorists dried up almost overnight and the bombings, which left 21 dead and almost 200 injured, including many maimed for life, cost them hugely in the propaganda war. And in an interview he confirmed that the IRA hierarchy in Dublin knew all along that the six Irishmen  <tgr>  arrested  <tgr>  for the explosions were innocent “ from the get go, from the very start. ” Now, Julie and Brian Hambleton, who lost their sister Maxine in the bombings and lead the city ’ s Justice4the21 campaign, called on West Midlands Police and David Cameron to take immediate action. Julie said : “ I am expecting West Midlands Police Chief Constable Chris Sims and West Midlands Police Force to interview with Mr Conway with immediate effect. “ And I hope that Mr Cameron, who a week ago told The House of Commons that the pub bombers must be found, takes note of this development and ensures that the police follow this through. ” Brian added : “ The police keep saying they won ’ t do anything because there is no fresh evidence. Well, here it is in black and white. It ’ s an admission. They have got to do something with this information. ” The Birmingham pub bombings - The 28 numbers that add up to a cover - up, say campaigners

 <arg>  court or judge sentenced  <arg>  for  <arg>  crime to  <arg>  sentence in  <arg>  place == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people. == Aftermath == One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a " carbon copy " of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their  <tgr>  sentences  <tgr> . The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street. The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the deaths of nearly 20 people, injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property. == See also == * Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions ( 1970 – 79 ) == References ==

" The bombings came after British police disrupted funeral arrangements for James McDade, a volunteer who had himself died in a premature explosion in England. “ Tempers were high and I, for one, certainly at first feared that the local IRA had knowingly caused these dreadful casualties – 21 people were killed and a great many others injured. ” “ I was appalled and personally ashamed of the bombing, which went against everything we claimed to stand for. ”  <tag>  Participant  </tag>  He said he told two other senior IRA figures, Dave O ’ Connell and  <tag>  Participant  </tag>  Kevin Mallon “ exactly what I thought ” when they  <tgr>  met up  <tgr> . “ In fact, both men were themselves furious, fully recognising not just the damage the bombing had caused to the IRA but its immorality as well. ” McDade, a lieutenant in the Birmingham Brigade of the IRA, blew himself up while trying to plant a bomb at Coventry Telephone exchange a week before the pub bombings. Neither The Mulberry Bush nor The Tavern in The Town had any military connection. Normal IRA procedure at the time for any attack on non - military targets was to give a 30 - minute warning in order for full evacuations to take place.

" We are Boston strong, we are America strong, and choosing to mess with us was a terrible idea. So how's that for your VICTIM impact statement? ”'He is a leech'Several victims condemned Tsarnaev for coming to the U. S. as an immigrant from Russia, enjoying the benefits of living here and then attacking American citizens. “ He is a leech, abusing the privilege of American freedom, and he spit in the face of the American dream, ” said Jennifer Rogers, an older sister of slain MIT Officer Sean Collier. Bill Richard, whose 8 - year - old son, Martin, was the youngest person killed in the bombing, said Tsarnaev could have backed out of the plot and reported his brother to authorities. Instead, Richard said, “ he chose hate.  <tag>  Destroyer  </tag>  He chose destruction. He chose  <tgr>  death  <tgr> . This is all on him. ” Richard noted that his family would have preferred that  <tag>  Defendant  </tag>  Tsarnaev receive a life sentence so that he could have had “ a lifetime to reconcile with himself what he did that day. ” Richard said his family has chosen love, kindness and peace, adding : “ That is what makes us different than him. ” Fatima Tlisova of VOA's Russian service contributed to this report from Boston. Some information for this report came from Reuters and AP.

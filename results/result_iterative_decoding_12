The court on Tuesday  <tgr>  indicted  <tgr>  Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast, including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder. Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror, and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism. Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained. They are described as ethnic Uighurs, a minority group based in China's Xinjiang region. They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September. Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation. The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades, and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured. Of the dead, 14 were tourists. The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness, which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror. Authorities, however, have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country's huge tourism industry. Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests. Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others. The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb. Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived, said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai. Doubts about motive
output:

 <arg>  died at  <arg>  place from  <arg>  medical issue, killed by  <arg>  killer The use of drones aligned with Obama ’ s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable, costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia. But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism. The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men, women and children in danger ”. This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case. The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of  <tag>  Victim Victim  </tag>  people killed in  <tag>  Instrument  </tag>  drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians  <tgr>  killed  <tgr>  – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher. That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including  <tag>  Place Place  </tag>  Afghanistan – where  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014. The country has since come under frequent US bombardment, in an unreported war that saw 1, 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015.

 <arg>  damaged  <arg>  using  <arg>  instrument in  <arg>  place Boston Marathon Bomber Apologizes to Survivors BOSTON — Moments before a federal judge sentenced him to death, Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev rose to his feet Wednesday and apologized to the victims and their loved ones for the first time. " I pray for your relief, for your healing,'' he said. Amid deep silence in the courtroom, the 21 - year - old ethnic Chechen said, " I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I've caused you, for the  <tgr>  damage  <tgr>  that I've done — irreparable damage.'' It was the first time Tsarnaev, who did not speak in his own defense at trial, had addressed the court. After Tsarnaev finished, U. S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr. began to speak, with his voice breaking several times. He officially imposed the death sentence on Tsarnaev that jurors had recommended unanimously. In May, after a 12 - week trial, Tsarnaev was found guilty of killing three people and injuring 264 in the April 15, 2013, bombing at the world - renowned race, where he and his brother, Tamerlan, 26, set off two pressure - cooker bombs near the finish line. Tsarnaev was also found guilty in the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer three days later as he and his brother fled. Tamerlan was killed during the getaway. Tsarnaev was found guilty of all 30 terrorism and other charges against him. Of those, 17 carried the possibility of a death sentence. During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings, prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older, radicalized brother. Victims speak out

The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist - inspired group. Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels. The police academy car bombing “ was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [ Cuba acting ] to avoid justice being done ”, Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima.

I think the jury did the right thing. ” Krystle Campbell's best friend,  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  Karen Rand McWatters, who lost a leg in the  <tgr>  attack  <tgr> , said Tsarnaev " can't possibly have had a soul to do such a horrible thing. ” In a message he scrawled in the boat he was found hiding in,  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  Tsarnaev said the attack was retaliation against the U. S. for its wars in Muslim countries. McWatters urged Tsarnaev to show remorse to discourage other jihadis from killing people in similar attacks. “ You can save them from these cowardly acts if you really have an ounce of regret, ” she said. Rebekah Gregory, a Texas woman who lost a leg in the bombing, defiantly told Tsarnaev she was not his victim. “ While your intention was to destroy America, what you have really accomplished is actually quite the opposite — you've unified us, ” she said. " We are Boston strong, we are America strong, and choosing to mess with us was a terrible idea. So how's that for your VICTIM impact statement? ”'He is a leech '

 <arg>  communicated with  <arg>  about  <arg>  topic at  <arg>  place (document does not specify in person or not, or one-way or not) The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s, each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and, when detonated, capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters. DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model, normally used for industrial work — with a U. S. price tag of around $ 5, 000 apiece, suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out — with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30. Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government ’ s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600, noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors. It also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model, although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed. Venezuela ’ s interior minister, Nestor Reverol, also  <tgr>  claimed  <tgr>  the government thwarted the attack using " special techniques and [ radio ] signal inhibitors ", which " disoriented " the  <tag>  Instrument Instrument  </tag>  drone that detonated closest to the  <tag>  Target  </tag>  presidential stand — a capability Bellingcat notes the Venezuelan security services are reported to have. The second drone was said by Reverol to have " lost control " and crashed into a nearby building. Bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion. It adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed.

 <arg>  died at  <arg>  place from  <arg>  medical issue, killed by  <arg>  killer The use of drones aligned with Obama ’ s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable, costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia. But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism. The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men, women and children in danger ”. This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case. The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people  <tgr>  killed  <tgr>  in  <tag>  Instrument  </tag>  drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the  <tag>  Killer  </tag>  US ’ s estimate of the number of  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher. That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014. The country has since come under frequent US bombardment, in an unreported war that saw 1, 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015. Afghan civilian casualties have been high, with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least 85 deaths in 2016. The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period. We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015.

The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist - inspired group. Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels. The police academy car bombing “ was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [ Cuba acting ] to avoid justice being done ”, Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima. Colombians, including Duque, planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing, the worst such attack in the country in 16 years.

The government in Bogota also asked Havana to act on an Interpol Red Notice against Rodriguez. The Cuban government did not respond publicly to that request or made a statement about the issue. Colombia has experienced several years of relative calm since the 2016 peace accord signed by then - President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) fighters. 190118182118648 With the landmark agreement turning the former rebels into a political party, the smaller ELN is considered the last active rebel group in the country. True to his election promises, Duque has taken a hard line against the ELN. Peace talks with the ELN began in February 2017 under Santos, but Duque has put them on hold until the rebels free all their hostages and stop attacks on military and civilian targets. The group is believed to be currently holding 17 hostages, some of them for several years.

The court on Tuesday  <tgr>  indicted  <tgr>  Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast, including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder. Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror, and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism. Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained. They are described as ethnic Uighurs, a minority group based in China's Xinjiang region. They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September. Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation. The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades, and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured. Of the dead, 14 were tourists. The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness, which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror. Authorities, however, have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country's huge tourism industry. Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests. Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others. The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb. Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived, said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai. Doubts about motive

Of those,  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  17 carried the possibility of a death  <tgr>  sentence  <tgr> . During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings, prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older, radicalized brother. Victims speak out Before the sentencing, a somber - looking  <tag>  Defendant  </tag>  Tsarnaev, wearing a dark sport jacket with a collared shirt and no tie, sat between his lawyers and listened as 24 people — some victims, some survivors — gave impact statements. They lashed out at him for his “ cowardly ” and “ disgusting ” acts, and several called upon him to apologize, trying to convince him that this would be his last chance to ask for forgiveness.

 <arg>  died at  <arg>  place from  <arg>  medical issue, killed by  <arg>  killer Reports from medical staff at Boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with BB ’ s, nails, and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage. That contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in Oklahoma City in 1995 and in the garage of the World Trade Center North Tower in 1993, which were intended to inflict damage on buildings, as well as people. IED ’ s pack a much smaller punch, are cheaper, and easier to carry. They have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan with devastating effect on American troops in convoys of military vehicles. Advertisement No one has taken responsibility for the twin bombings on Boylston Street that  <tgr>  killed  <tgr>  three people and injured more than  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  150 near the Boston marathon finish line. A senior US law enforcement official in Washington added that the fact that no group has taken responsibility has officials speculating that it might not be the work of a well - known international terrorist group like Al Qaeda, Hezbollah or one of its affiliates but a domestic group or individual inspired by the hallmark tactics of terrorist groups in recent years, The Pakistani Taliban also said in a statement it was not responsible for the attack, unlike the attempted car bombing in New York ’ s Times Square in 2010 that it claimed responsibility for. But officials in Washington have been warning about the possibility of so - called improvised explosive devises in recent weeks. In late february the White House established a new task force housed in the Department of Justice to apply the lessons learned from years of dealing with so - called improvised explosive devices — some large and powerful and others more limited in scope like the ones apparently set off on Boylston Street yesterday.

 <arg>  charged or indicted  <arg>  before  <arg>  court or judge for  <arg>  crime in  <arg>  place Thai Authorities Indict 2 Over August Shrine Attack A Bangkok military court has indicted two men accused of carrying out the August 17 bombing at a popular shrine that killed 20 people. The court on Tuesday  <tgr>  indicted  <tgr>  Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast, including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder. Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror, and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism. Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained. They are described as ethnic Uighurs, a minority group based in China's Xinjiang region. They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September. Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation. The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades, and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured. Of the dead, 14 were tourists. The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness, which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror. Authorities, however, have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country's huge tourism industry. Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests. Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others. The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb. Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived, said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai. Doubts about motive

 <arg>  died at  <arg>  place from  <arg>  medical issue, killed by  <arg>  killer There were ten times more air strikes in the covert war on terror during President Barack Obama ’ s presidency than under his predecessor, George W. Bush. Obama embraced the US  <tag>  Instrument Instrument  </tag>  drone programme, overseeing more strikes in his first year than Bush carried out during his entire presidency. A total of 563 strikes, largely by  <tag>  Instrument  </tag>  drones, targeted  <tag>  Target  </tag>  Pakistan,  <tag>  Target  </tag>  Somalia and  <tag>  Target  </tag>  Yemen during Obama ’ s two terms, compared to 57 strikes under  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  Bush. Between 384 and 807 civilians were  <tgr>  killed  <tgr>  in those countries, according to reports logged by the Bureau. The use of drones aligned with Obama ’ s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable, costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia. But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism. The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men, women and children in danger ”. This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case. The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher.

Seven " incident centres " were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974. == The bombing ==

The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people. == Aftermath == One of the police  <tag>  Researcher  </tag>  officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a " carbon copy " of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four  <tag>  Defendant  </tag>  people were already serving their sentences.

 <arg>  communicated with  <arg>  about  <arg>  topic at  <arg>  place (document does not specify in person or not, or one-way or not) Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests. Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others. The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb. Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived, said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai. Doubts about motive Early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that  <tag>  Transporter  </tag>  Thailand in July forcibly repatriated more than 100  <tag>  PassengerArtifact  </tag>  Uighurs to  <tag>  Destination  </tag>  China, where it is feared they face persecution. The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists, who figured prominently among the  <tag>  Target  </tag>  victims of the bombing. But Thai officials  <tgr>  reject  <tgr>  any political or religious motive, sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang. Still, skepticism about the  <tag>  Participant  </tag>  police explanation on the  <tag>  Target  </tag>  shrine attack has abounded because of leaks, contradictions, misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation. The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last May, when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government. Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang said before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage, witnesses, DNA matching and physical evidence, in addition to their confessions.

 <arg>  was injured by  <arg>  using  <arg>  in  <arg>  body part with  <arg>  medical issue at  <arg>  place On 27 August 1975 a Provisional IRA bomb exploded without warning at the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey, England. There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured, some severely. Two off - duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing. == Background == In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven " incident centres " were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974. == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the  <tag>  ExplosiveDevice  </tag>  bomb exploded at 9 : 20, injuring 23  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  civilians and 10 off - duty  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the  <tgr>  injuries  <tgr>  were very serious, with at least three  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the  <tag>  Artifact  </tag>  roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people. == Aftermath ==

 <arg>  transported  <arg>  in  <arg>  from  <arg>  place to  <arg>  place Two gunmen entered the campus right after the explosion and shot at many Afghan soldiers before being gunned down during the clashes. Defense ministry officials said the Taliban had used U. S. - made armored Humvee vehicles captured from Afghan forces as a car bomb in order to breach the military fortifications. A second source residing in Maidan Wardak province said more than 100 members of National Directorate of Security ( NDS ) were killed in the complex attack. " I have been in touch with the NDS official in the province and they told me that over 100 members of the NDS were killed in the big explosion, " the former provincial official said. Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak said  <tag>  Identifier  </tag>  he saw bodies of 35 Afghan forces in the  <tag>  Place  </tag>  hospital. " Many more were killed. Several  <tag>  PassengerArtifact  </tag>  bodies were transported to  <tag>  Destination  </tag>  Kabul city and many injured were  <tgr>  transferred  <tgr>  to hospitals in Kabul, " said Hotak, adding that " the government was hiding the accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in the morale of the Afghan forces. " " The explosion was very powerful. The whole building has collapsed, " he said. Government officials in Maidan Wardak and Kabul declined to comment when asked if they were obscuring the death toll. Two senior officials in the interior ministry said the exact casualty figures were not being disclosed to prevent unrest within the armed forces. " I have been told not to make the death toll figures public. It is frustrating to hide the facts, " said a senior interior ministry official in Kabul. A senior NDS official in Kabul said at least 50 people were killed or wounded in the complex attack. Abdurrahman Mangal, spokesman for the provincial governor in Maidan Wardak said 12 people were killed and 12 were injured when the car bomb exploded near the Afghan special forces unit.

Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror, and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism. Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained. They are described as ethnic Uighurs, a minority group based in China's Xinjiang region. They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September. Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation. The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades, and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured. Of the dead, 14 were tourists. The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness, which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror. Authorities, however, have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country's huge tourism industry. Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests. Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others. The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb. Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived, said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai. Doubts about motive

The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate President  <tag>  Target  </tag>  Nicolás Maduro using two  <tag>  Instrument  </tag>  drones loaded with explosives. The president had been giving a  <tgr>  speech  <tgr>  which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred. Initial video from a state - owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro, those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera. But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions. AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim — suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat. Since then more footage has emerged, including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building. Bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack, including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech, and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up. The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s, each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and, when detonated, capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters.

 <arg>  died at  <arg>  place from  <arg>  medical issue, killed by  <arg>  killer The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men, women and children in danger ”. This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case. The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher. That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014. The country has since come under frequent US bombardment, in an unreported war that saw 1, 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015. Afghan civilian casualties have been high, with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least 85  <tgr>  deaths  <tgr>  in 2016. The Bureau recorded 65 to 105  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  civilian deaths during this period. We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015. Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama ’ s first term. The pace of attacks had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of Bush ’ s term, after four years pocked by occasional strikes. However in the year after taking office, Obama ordered more drone strikes than Bush did during his entire presidency. The 54 strikes in 2009 all took place in Pakistan.

The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast, including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder. Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror, and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism. Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the  <tgr>  bombing  <tgr>  but only  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  Bilal and  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  Mieraili have been detained. They are described as ethnic Uighurs, a minority group based in China's Xinjiang region.  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September. Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation. The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades, and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured. Of the dead, 14 were tourists. The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness, which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror. Authorities, however, have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country's huge tourism industry. Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests. Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others. The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb. Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived, said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai. Doubts about motive

The FBI and NYPD are trying to understand what motivation lay behind the blast. “ We will look at individuals. We will look at associations. We will look at social media, ” William Sweeney, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI New York Field Office,  <tgr>  said  <tgr> . “ Until we have that information it is not fair for us to give a conclusion [ as to motivation ], ”  <tag>  Communicator  </tag>  DeBlasio said. “ Let the law enforcement experts draw the conclusions. ” Police Commissioner James O ’ Neill, whose first day in the position was Saturday, told reporters on Sunday that police were still gathering evidence. AD “ We did find some components indicative of an IED … that went off intentionally, ” O ’ Neill said. Late Saturday, police had ruled out natural gas as a possible cause of the blast. AD The New York Police Department ’ s counterterrorism bureau responded to the explosion, along with officials with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. While O ’ Neill said authorities were still trying to determine what, precisely, exploded, the NYPD counterterrorism bureau posted a photo online earlier Saturday showing what appeared to be a dumpster or garbage container mangled by a blast :

Kieran Conway, who was head of the IRA ’ s intelligence - gathering department in the 1970s, broke a 40 - year silence by the organisation to make the admission. He admitted he was “ appalled and ashamed ” because he claimed the bombing of civilians went against everything it stood for. He said the attacks on The Mulberry Bush and The Tavern in The Town had been in revenge for the death of IRA bomber  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  James McDade. At first he feared that the timing of the attacks - with very little warning - had been deliberate because “ tempers were high ”.

Taliban representatives have met several times with U. S. officials in recent months, but last week threatened to suspend the fledgling process, lambasting Washington for changing the agenda of the talks and " unilaterally " adding new subjects. The insurgents have long refused to hold direct talks with the Kabul government -- despite U. S. pleas -- which the Taliban dismisses as a puppet of Washington. In recent years the Afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures. Last year Ghani has said 28, 000 Afghan police officers and soldiers have been killed since 2015, breaking the longstanding suppression on casualty data. Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline terrorist group said they have killed 190 people in the complex attack.

The Taliban bombing targeted the provincial governor's convoy in Mohammad Agha district. The provincial governor and spy chief traveling in the convoy were unharmed. The Taliban have ramped up their attacks on security forces and government facilities in recent months, while Afghan and U. S. troops have increased operations against the militants'field commanders. Military sources say around 35 members of the country's security forces are killed every day in attacks and clashes.

 <arg>  died at  <arg>  place from  <arg>  medical issue, killed by  <arg>  killer The use of drones aligned with Obama ’ s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable, costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia. But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism. The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men, women and children in danger ”. This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case. The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of  <tag>  Target  </tag>  people  <tgr>  killed  <tgr>  in  <tag>  Instrument  </tag>  drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher. That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014. The country has since come under frequent US bombardment, in an unreported war that saw 1, 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015. Afghan civilian casualties have been high, with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least 85 deaths in 2016. The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period. We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015.

Julie said : “ I am expecting West Midlands Police Chief Constable Chris Sims and West Midlands Police Force to interview with Mr Conway with immediate effect. “ And I hope that Mr Cameron, who a week ago told The House of Commons that the pub bombers must be found, takes note of this development and ensures that the police follow this through. ” Brian added : “ The police keep saying they won ’ t do anything because there is no fresh evidence.

After Tsarnaev finished, U. S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr. began to speak, with his voice breaking several times. He officially imposed the death sentence on Tsarnaev that jurors had recommended unanimously. In May, after a 12 - week trial, Tsarnaev was found guilty of killing three people and injuring 264 in the April 15, 2013, bombing at the world - renowned race, where he and his brother, Tamerlan, 26, set off two pressure - cooker bombs near the finish line.  <tag>  Attacker  </tag>  Tsarnaev was also found guilty in the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police  <tag>  Target  </tag>  officer three days later as he and his brother fled.  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  Tamerlan was killed during the getaway. Tsarnaev was found guilty of all 30 terrorism and other  <tgr>  charges  <tgr>  against him. Of those,  <tag>  Defendant Defendant  </tag>  17 carried the possibility of a death sentence. During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings, prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older, radicalized brother. Victims speak out Before the sentencing, a somber - looking Tsarnaev, wearing a dark sport jacket with a collared shirt and no tie, sat between his lawyers and listened as 24 people — some victims, some survivors — gave impact statements. They lashed out at him for his “ cowardly ” and “ disgusting ” acts, and several called upon him to apologize, trying to convince him that this would be his last chance to ask for forgiveness. Tsarnaev, his chair turned toward the lectern from which the victims spoke, picked at his beard and gazed downward most of the time, only occasionally looking at the speakers.

 <arg>  transported  <arg>  in  <arg>  from  <arg>  place to  <arg>  place But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive, sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang. Still, skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks, contradictions, misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation. The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last May, when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government. Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang said before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage, witnesses, DNA matching and physical evidence, in addition to their confessions. Security camera footage from the Erawan Shrine showed a man wearing a yellow T - shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine, took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away. Time stamps on closed circuit TV footage showed he  <tgr>  left  <tgr>  the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred, during evening rush hour as the area in central Bangkok was filled with people. Police believe that Bilal is the yellow - shirted man who planted the bomb and Yusufu is believed to have detonated the bomb. Bilal, was initially identified as Adem Karadag, which was the name on a fake Turkish passport in his possession when he was arrested Aug. 29. He was arrested at one of two apartments police raided on the outskirts of Bangkok. Yusufu was arrested Sept. 1 near the Thai - Cambodia border, carrying a Chinese passport indicating he was from Xinjiang. Police said his DNA and fingerprints were found in both raided apartments, including on a container of gunpowder.

The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist - inspired group. Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels. The police academy car bombing “ was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [ Cuba acting ] to avoid justice being done ”, Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima. Colombians, including Duque, planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing, the worst such attack in the country in 16 years.

AD The New York Police Department ’ s counterterrorism bureau responded to the explosion, along with officials with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. While O ’ Neill said authorities were still trying to determine what, precisely, exploded, the NYPD counterterrorism bureau posted a photo online earlier Saturday showing what appeared to be a dumpster or garbage container mangled by a blast : Police in New York also reported shortly after 11 p. m. that they had found the “ possible secondary device ” a few blocks away from the Chelsea explosion scene, on 27th Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues. Police directed people away from that intersection, and one officer could be heard telling pedestrians that “ there is a possible explosive ” in the area. AD Not long after midnight, police  <tgr>  said  <tgr>  in a statement that they were asking people in the area of this potential explosive to move away from their windows “ until we clear the suspicious package, ” although officers did not fully evacuate the area. AD According to the Associated Press, the second device was removed with a robot and taken to the department firing range in the Bronx. O ’ Neill said Sunday that two “ very dedicated ” former New York state troopers had responded to the initial report of the blast last night. In a search for other explosives, they had parked their vehicle on 27th Street. Walking down the block, they found the second, unexploded device, O ’ Neill said. AD Reports of another suspicious package at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue turned out to be a false alarm — the package was only garbage, J. Peter Donald, a police spokesman, posted on Twitter around 12 : 30 a. m. Sunday.

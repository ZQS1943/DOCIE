Birmingham pub bombings : Minute by minute - 24 hours that changed our city forever Funding for the terrorists dried up almost overnight and the bombings, which left 21 dead and almost 200 injured, including many maimed for life, cost them hugely in the propaganda war.

 <arg>  court or judge sentenced  <arg>  for  <arg>  crime to  <arg>  sentence in  <arg>  place == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people. == Aftermath == One of the police  <tag>  Researcher  </tag>  officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a " carbon copy " of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their  <tgr>  sentences  <tgr> . The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when  <tag>  Detainee  </tag>  they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street. The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the deaths of nearly 20 people, injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property. == See also == * Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions ( 1970 – 79 ) == References ==

Wearing a dark blue jump suit,  <tag>  Defendant  </tag>  Rahimi, 28, shuffled slowly into federal court in Manhattan and had several coughing fits during the brief hearing.  <tag>  Victim  </tag>  He suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing. He spoke only once, when U. S. District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday. " Yes, sir, " Rahimi said. Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U. S. citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Sept. 17. It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people. The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey, although that detonation did not injure anyone. Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey. He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds, delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed.

 <arg>  died at  <arg>  place from  <arg>  medical issue, killed by  <arg>  killer Officials said at least 214 people were wounded in 27 different attacks launched in 18 cities, shattering a relative calm which had held in the lead - up to the start on Saturday of the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. In Monday's deadliest attack -- a string of roadside bombs and a car bomb followed by a suicide attack targeting emergency responders in the town of Taji -- at least 42 people were killed and 40 wounded, according to two medical officials. " I heard explosions in the distance so I left my house and I saw a car outside, " said 40 - year - old Taji resident Abu Mohammed, who added that police inspectors concluded the vehicle was a car bomb. " We asked the neighbors to leave their houses, but when they were leaving, the bomb went off. " Abu Mohammed said he witnessed the  <tgr>  deaths  <tgr>  of an elderly woman carrying a newborn baby and of the policeman who had first concluded the car was packed with explosives. An Agence France Presse reporter at the scene said a row of houses were completely destroyed, and residents were rummaging through the rubble in search of victims and their belongings. In Baghdad, meanwhile, a car bomb outside a government office responsible for producing identity papers in the Shiite bastion of Sadr City killed at least 12 people and wounded 22 others, security and medical officials said. " This attack is a terrible crime against humanity, because they did it during Ramadan, while people are fasting, " said one elderly witness who declined to be identified. An AFP journalist said eight nearby cars were badly burned and many of the victims of the 9 : 30 am ( 0630 GMT ) attack could not be identified because their papers were inside the offices that were targeted.
